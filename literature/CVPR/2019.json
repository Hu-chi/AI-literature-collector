Conceptually, humans are readily able to understand new concepts given just a few examples, while in more pragmatic terms, limited-example training situations are common practice. Recent effective approaches to few-shot learning employ a metric-learning framework to learn a feature similarity comparison between a query (test) example, and the few support (training) examples.  However, these approaches treat each support class independently from one another, never looking at the entire task as a whole.  Because of this, they are constrained to use a single set of features for all possible test-time tasks, which hinders the ability to distinguish the most relevant dimensions for the task at hand.  In this work, we introduce a Category Traversal Module that can be inserted as a plug-and-play module into most metric-learning based few-shot learners.  This component traverses across the entire support set at once, identifying task-relevant features based on both intra-class commonality and inter-class uniqueness in the feature space.  Incorporating our module improves performance considerably (5%-10% relative) over baseline systems on both miniImageNet and tieredImageNet benchmarks, with overall performance competitive with the most recent state-of-the-art systems.", "title": "Finding Task-Relevant Features for Few-Shot Learning by Category Traversal"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Kim_Edge-Labeling_Graph_Neural_Network_for_Few-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel edge-labeling graph neural network (EGNN), which adapts a deep neural network on the edge-labeling graph, for few-shot learning. The previous graph neural network (GNN) approaches in few-shot learning have been based on the node-labeling framework, which implicitly models the intra-cluster similarity and the inter-cluster dissimilarity. In contrast, the proposed EGNN learns to predict the edge-labels rather than the node-labels on the graph that enables the evolution of an explicit clustering by iteratively updating the edge-labels with direct exploitation of both intra-cluster similarity and the inter-cluster dissimilarity. It is also well suited for performing on various numbers of classes without retraining, and can be easily extended to perform a transductive inference. The parameters of the EGNN are learned by episodic training with an edge-labeling loss to obtain a well-generalizable model for unseen low-data problem.

To accomplish this goal it must learn to output the appropriate classification weight vectors for those two types of classes. To build our meta-model we make use of two main innovations: we propose the use of a Denoising Autoencoder network (DAE) that (during training) takes as input a set of classification weights corrupted with Gaussian noise and learns to reconstruct the target-discriminative classification weights. In this case, the injected noise on the classification weights serves the role of regularizing the weight generating meta-model. Furthermore, in order to capture the co-dependencies between different classes in a given task instance of our meta-model, we propose to implement the DAE model as a Graph Neural Network (GNN).

Deep neural networks are usually over-parameterized for their tasks in order to achieve good performances, thus are likely to have underutilized computational resources.

To this end, we propose a novel optimization method named Neural Rejuvenation. As its name suggests, our method detects dead neurons and computes resource utilization in real time, rejuvenates dead neurons by resource reallocation and reinitialization, and trains them with new training schemes.

Rare classes tend to get a concentrated representation in the classification space which hampers the generalization of learned boundaries to new test examples.

Subsequently, we present a novel framework for uncertainty based class imbalance learning that follows two key insights: First, classification boundaries should be extended further away from a more uncertain (rare) class to avoid over-fitting and enhance its generalization. Second, each sample should be modeled as a multi-variate Gaussian distribution with a mean vector and a covariance matrix defined by the sample's uncertainty. The learned boundaries should respect not only the individual samples but also their distribution in the feature space. Our proposed approach efficiently utilizes sample and class uncertainty information to learn robust features and more generalizable classifiers.

This task is challenging due to the multimodal nature of the future, namely, given a partial history, there is more than one plausible prediction. Yet, the state-of-the-art methods seem not fully responsive to this innate variabil- ity. Hence, how to better foresee the forthcoming trajectory in dynamic scenes has to be more thoroughly pursued. To this end, we propose a novel Imitative Decision Learning (IDL) approach. It delves deeper into the key that inher- ently characterizes the multimodality - the latent decision. The proposed IDL first infers the distribution of such latent decisions by learning from moving histories. A policy is then generated by taking the sampled latent decision into account to predict the future. Different plausible upcoming paths corresponds to each sampled latent decision. This ap- proach significantly differs from the mainstream literature that relies on a predefined latent variable to extrapolate di- verse predictions. In order to augment the understanding of the latent decision and resultant mutimodal future, we in- vestigate their connection through mutual information op- timization. Moreover, the proposed IDL integrates spatial and temporal dependencies into one single framework, in contrast to handling them with two-step settings.

To deal with challenging cases where objects are occluded or missing, previous work relies on greedy data association strategies that make decisions for each frame individually. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to defer the decision making for a target object in each frame, until a global view can be established with the entire video being taken into consideration. Our approach is in the same spirit as Multiple Hypotheses Tracking (MHT) methods, making several critical adaptations for the VOS problem. We employ the bounding box (bbox) hypothesis for tracking tree formation, and the multiple hypotheses are spawned by propagating the preceding bbox into the detected bbox proposals within a gated region starting from the initial object mask in the first frame. The gated region is determined by a gating scheme which takes into account a more comprehensive motion model rather than the simple Kalman filtering model in traditional MHT. To further design more customized algorithms tailored for VOS, we develop a novel mask propagation score instead of the appearance similarity score that could be brittle due to large deformations. The mask propagation score, together with the motion score, determines the affinity between the hypotheses during tree pruning. Finally, a novel mask merging strategy is employed to handle mask conflicts between objects.

In this paper, we propose to address the problem by introducing Gaussian kernels to dynamically optimize temporal scale of each action proposal.

While these models are compact, they typically operate by repeated application of a small weight matrix to all the frames in a video. For example, recurrent neural network based methods compute a hidden state for every frame of the video using a recurrent weight matrix. Similarly, cluster-and-aggregate based methods such as NetVLAD have a learnable clustering matrix which is used to assign soft-clusters to every frame in the video. Since these models look at every frame in the video, the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) is still large even though the memory footprint is small. In this work, we focus on building compute-efficient video classification models which process fewer frames and hence have less number of FLOPs. Similar to memory efficient models, we use the idea of distillation albeit in a different setting. Specifically, in our case, a compute-heavy teacher which looks at all the frames in the video is used to train a compute-efficient student which looks at only a small fraction of frames in the video. This is in contrast to a typical memory efficient Teacher-Student setting, wherein both the teacher and the student look at all the frames in the video but the student has fewer parameters. Our work thus complements the research on memory efficient video classification. We do an extensive evaluation with three types of models for video classification, viz., (i) recurrent models (ii) cluster-and-aggregate models and (iii) memory-efficient cluster-and-aggregate models and show that in each of these cases, a see-it-all teacher can be used to train a compute efficient see-very-little student.

When combined with adversarial training, our feature denoising networks substantially improve the state-of-the-art in adversarial robustness in both white-box and black-box attack settings. On ImageNet, under 10-iteration PGD white-box attacks where prior art has 27.9% accuracy, our method achieves 55.7%; even under extreme 2000-iteration PGD white-box attacks, our method secures 42.6% accuracy. Our method was ranked first in Competition on Adversarial Attacks and Defenses (CAAD) 2018 --- it achieved 50.6% classification accuracy on a secret, ImageNet-like test dataset against 48 unknown attackers, surpassing the runner-up approach by  10%.

We develop Unsupervised Open Domain Transfer Network (UODTN), which learns both the backbone classification network and GCN jointly by reducing the SGMD, enforcing the limited balance constraint and minimizing the classification loss on S. UODTN better preserves the semantic structure and enforces the consistency between the learned domain invariant visual features and the semantic embeddings.

The weak setting refers to matching a target person with an untrimmed gallery video where we only know that the identity appears in the video without the requirement of annotating the identity in any frame of the video during the training procedure. Hence, for a video, there could be multiple video-level labels. We cast this weakly supervised person re-id challenge into a multi-instance multi-label learning (MIML) problem. In particular, we develop a Cross-View MIML (CV-MIML) method that is able to explore potential intraclass person images from all the camera views by incorporating the intra-bag alignment and the cross-view bag alignment.

To remedy these issues, we propose a lightweight generator network, which reduces noises in motion vectors and captures fine motion details, achieving a more Discriminative Motion Cue (DMC) representation. Since optical flow is a more accurate motion representation, we train the DMC generator to approximate flow using a reconstruction loss and a generative adversarial loss, jointly with the downstream action classification task.

(2) privacy leakage: the model trained using a conventional method may involuntarily reveal the private information of the patients in the training dataset. The smaller the dataset, the worse the privacy leakage.  To tackle the above two challenges, we introduce a novel stochastic gradient descent (SGD) scheme, named patient privacy preserving SGD (P3SGD), which performs the model update of the SGD in the patient level via a large-step update built upon each patient's data. Specifically, to protect privacy and regularize the CNN model, we propose to inject the well-designed noise into the updates. Moreover, we equip our P3SGD with an elaborated strategy to adaptively control the scale of the injected noise. To validate the effectiveness of P3SGD, we perform extensive experiments on a real-world clinical dataset and quantitatively demonstrate the superior ability of P3SGD in reducing the risk of overfitting.

Existing approaches either applied multi-view planar (2D) networks or directly used volumetric (3D) networks for this purpose, but both of them are not ideal: 2D networks cannot capture 3D contexts effectively, and 3D networks are both memory-consuming and less stable arguably due to the lack of pre-trained models.  In this paper, we bridge the gap between 2D and 3D using a novel approach named Elastic Boundary Projection (EBP). The key observation is that, although the object is a 3D volume, what we really need in segmentation is to find its boundary which is a 2D surface. Therefore, we place a number of pivot points in the 3D space, and for each pivot, we determine its distance to the object boundary along a dense set of directions. This creates an elastic shell around each pivot which is initialized as a perfect sphere. We train a 2D deep network to determine whether each ending point falls within the object, and gradually adjust the shell so that it gradually converges to the actual shape of the boundary and thus achieves the goal of segmentation. EBP allows boundary-based segmentation without cutting a 3D volume into slices or patches, which stands out from conventional 2D and 3D approaches.

We propose the soft multilabel-guided hard negative mining to learn a discriminative embedding for the unlabeled target domain by exploring the similarity consistency of the visual features and the soft multilabels of unlabeled target pairs.

Yet, how to effectively cluster, especially on a large-scale (i.e. million-level or above) dataset, remains an open question. A key challenge lies in the complex variations of cluster patterns, which make it difficult for conventional clustering methods to meet the needed accuracy.

Under the standard paradigm of network fine-tuning, an entirely new CNN is learned per task, and the final network size is independent of task complexity. This is wasteful, since simple tasks require smaller networks than more complex tasks, and limits the number of tasks that can be solved simultaneously. To address these problems, we propose a transfer learning procedure, denoted NetTailor, in which layers of a pre-trained CNN are used as universal blocks that can be combined with small task-specific layers to generate new networks. Besides minimizing classification error, the new network is trained to mimic the internal activations of a strong unconstrained CNN, and minimize its complexity by the combination of 1) a soft-attention mechanism over blocks and 2) complexity regularization constraints. In this way, NetTailor can adapt the network architecture, not just its weights, to the target task. Experiments show that networks adapted to simple tasks, such as character or traffic sign recognition, become significantly smaller than those adapted to hard tasks, such as fine-grained recognition. More importantly, due to the modular nature of the procedure, this reduction in network complexity is achieved without compromise of either parameter sharing across tasks, or classification accuracy.", "title": "NetTailor: Tuning the Architecture, Not Just the Weights"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Tang_Learning-Based_Sampling_for_Natural_Image_Matting_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "The goal of natural image matting is the estimation of opacities of a user-defined foreground object that is essential in creating realistic composite imagery.

In this paper, we propose the estimation of the layer colors through the use of deep neural networks prior to the opacity estimation. The layer color estimation is a better match for the capabilities of neural networks, and the availability of these colors substantially increase the performance of opacity estimation due to the reduced number of unknowns in the compositing equation. A prominent approach to matting in parallel to ours is called sampling-based matting, which involves gathering color samples from known-opacity regions to predict the layer colors.

However, existing methods only use features from plain convolution layers or a simple aggregation of multi-level features to calculate cost volume, which is insufficient because stereo matching requires discriminative features to identify corresponding pixels in rectified stereo image pairs. In this paper, we propose a unary features descriptor using multi-level context ultra-aggregation (MCUA), which encapsulates all convolutional features into a more discriminative representation by intra- and inter-level features combination. Specifically, a child module that takes low-resolution images as input captures larger context information; the larger context information from each layer is densely connected to the main branch of the network. MCUA makes good usage of multi-level features with richer context and performs the image-to-image prediction holistically. We introduce our MCUA scheme for cost volume calculation and test it on PSM-Net. We also evaluate our method on Scene Flow and KITTI 2012/2015 stereo datasets.

Accordingly, these inconsistent annotations, which are usually provided by public databases, commonly work as the (inaccurate) groundtruth to supervise network training, leading to the degraded accuracy.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel filter pruning method, namely Filter Pruning via Geometric Median (FPGM), to compress the model regardless of those two requirements. Unlike previous methods, FPGM compresses CNN models by pruning filters with redundancy, rather than those with\"relatively less\" importance. When applied to two image classification benchmarks, our method validates its usefulness and strengths. Notably, on CIFAR-10, FPGM reduces more than 52% FLOPs on ResNet-110 with even 2.69% relative accuracy improvement.

To this end, we first present a novel regularized maximum likelihood estimator for robust estimating covariance of generalized Gaussian, which can be optimized by a modified iterative re-weighted method. Then, to efficiently estimate the covariance of generaized Gaussian under deep CNN architectures, we approximate this re-weighted method by developing an unrolling re-weighted module and a square root covariance layer. In this way, 3GNet can be flexibly trained in an end-to-end manner.

Besides the standard classification backbone network, another \"destruction and construction\" stream is introduced to carefully \"destruct\" and then \"reconstruct\" the input image, for learning discriminative regions and features. More specifically, for \"destruction\", we first partition the input image into local regions and then shuffle them by a Region Confusion Mechanism (RCM). To correctly recognize these destructed images, the classification network has to pay more attention to discriminative regions for spotting the differences. To compensate the noises introduced by RCM, an adversarial loss, which distinguishes original images from destructed ones, is applied to reject noisy patterns introduced by RCM. For \"construction\", a region alignment network, which tries to restore the original spatial layout of local regions, is followed to model the semantic correlation among local regions. By jointly training with parameter sharing, our proposed DCL injects more discriminative local details to the classification network.

We fill in the gap by presenting DeepFashion2 to address these issues. It is a versatile benchmark of four tasks including clothes detection, pose estimation, segmentation, and retrieval.

To solve this problem accurately, the recent state-of-the-art algorithm reduces this task to set of local linear subspace reconstruction and clustering problem using Grassmann manifold representation [34]. Unfortunately, their method missed on some of the critical issues associated with the modeling of surface deformations, for e.g., the dependence of a local surface deformation on its neighbors. Furthermore, their representation to group high dimensional data points inevitably introduce the drawbacks of categorizing samples on the high-dimensional Grassmann manifold [32, 31]. Hence, to deal with such limitations with [34], we propose an algorithm that jointly exploits the benefit of high-dimensional Grassmann manifold to perform reconstruction, and its equivalent lower-dimensional representation to infer suitable clusters. To accomplish this, we project each Grassmannians onto a lower-dimensional Grassmann manifold which preserves and respects the deformation of the structure w.r.t its neighbors. These Grassmann points in the lower-dimension then act as a representative for the selection of high-dimensional Grassmann samples to perform each local reconstruction. In practice, our algorithm provides a geometrically efficient way to solve dense NRSfM by switching between manifolds based on its benefit and usage.

Based on this intuition, a Product Quantization Zero-Shot Learning (PQZSL) method is proposed to learn embeddings as well as quantizers to compress visual features into compact codes for Approximate NN (ANN) search. Particularly, visual features are projected into an orthogonal semantic space, and then the Product Quantization (PQ) is utilized to quantize individual properties. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that unseen classes are represented by the Cartesian product of quantized properties with little quantization error.

A Coarse-Fine CNN, able to exploit multi-frequency ToF data for MPI correction, is trained on synthetic data with ground truth in a supervised way. In parallel, an adversarial learning strategy, based on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) framework, is used to perform an unsupervised pixel-level domain adaptation  from synthetic to real world data, exploiting unlabeled real world acquisitions.  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to effectively denoise real world data and to outperform state-of-the-art techniques.", "title": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for ToF Data Denoising With Adversarial Learning"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Cao_Learning_Independent_Object_Motion_From_Unlabelled_Stereoscopic_Videos_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "We present a system for learning motion maps of independently moving objects from stereo videos.

The goal is to predict the spatial location of a ground-level query image by matching it to a large geotagged aerial image database (e.g., satellite imagery).  This is a challenging task due to the drastic differences in their viewpoints and visual appearances. Existing deep learning methods for this problem have been focused on maximizing feature similarity between spatially close-by image pairs, while minimizing other images pairs which are far apart. They do so by deep feature embedding based on visual appearance in those ground-and-aerial images.  However, in everyday life, humans commonly use orientation information as an important cue for the task of spatial localization.  Inspired by this insight, this paper proposes a novel method which endows deep neural networks with the `commonsense' of orientation.  Given a ground-level spherical panoramic image as query input (and a large georeferenced satellite image database), we design a Siamese network which explicitly encodes the orientation (i.e., spherical directions) of each pixel of the images. Our method significantly boosts the discriminative power of the learned deep features, leading to a much higher recall and precision outperforming all previous methods.  Our network is also more compact using only 1/5th number of parameters than a previously best-performing network.

Regarding this issue, this work proposes Multi-Scale Adversarial Correlation Matching (MS-ACM), a novel learning framework for structure-aware view synthesis.

Instead, it models structures as self-correlation coefficients extracted from multi-scale feature maps in transformed spaces. In training, the feature space attempts to push the correlation distances between the synthesized and target images far apart, thus amplifying inconsistent structures. At the same time, the view synthesis network minimizes such correlation distances by fixing mistakes it makes. With such adversarial training, structural errors of different scales and levels are iteratively discovered and reduced, preserving both global layouts and fine-grained details.

However, those cameras only produce noisy and asynchronous events of intensity changes rather than frames, where conventional vision-based gait recognition algorithms can't be directly applied. To address this, we propose a new Event-based Gait Recognition (EV-Gait) approach, which exploits motion consistency to effectively remove noise, and uses a deep neural network to recognise gait from the event streams. To evaluate the performance of EV-Gait, we collect two event-based gait datasets, one from real-world experiments and the other by converting the publicly available RGB gait recognition benchmark CASIA-B. Extensive experiments show that EV-Gait can get nearly 96% recognition accuracy in the real-world settings, while on the CASIA-B benchmark it achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art RGB-based gait recognition approaches.", "title": "EV-Gait: Event-Based Robust Gait Recognition Using Dynamic Vision Sensors"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Cui_ToothNet_Automatic_Tooth_Instance_Segmentation_and_Identification_From_Cone_Beam_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "This paper proposes a method that uses deep convolutional neural networks to achieve automatic and accurate tooth instance segmentation and identification from CBCT (cone beam CT) images for digital dentistry.

Our key observation is thatthe precise inter-photon timing measured by a SPAD can be used for estimating scene brightness under ambient lighting conditions, even for very bright scenes. We develop a theoretical model for PF-SPAD imaging, and derive a scene brightness estimator based on the average time of darkness between successive photons detected by a PF-SPAD pixel. Our key insight is that due to the stochastic nature of photon arrivals, this estimator does not suffer from a hard saturation limit.

We derive a closed form expression for the optimal flux, which is quasi-depth-invariant, and depends on the ambient light strength. The optimal flux is lower than what a SPAD typically measures in real world scenarios, but surprisingly, considerably higher than what is conventionally suggested for avoiding distortions.

This motivates us to propose a unified spatial-spectral paradigm for HSI denoising. As the new model is hard to optimize, An efficient algorithm motivated by alternating minimization is developed. This is done by first learning a low-dimensional orthogonal basis and the related reduced image from the noisy HSI. Then, the non-local low-rank denoising and iterative regularization are developed to refine the reduced image and orthogonal basis, respectively.

When training a segmentation model, it is common to fine-tune a classification network pre-trained on a large-scale dataset. However, as an intrinsic property of the classification model, invariance to spatial perturbation resulting from the lose of detail-sensitivity prevents segmentation networks from achieving high performance. The use of standard poolings is one of the key factors for this invariance. The most common standard poolings are max and average pooling. Max pooling can increase both the invariance to spatial perturbations and the non-linearity of the networks. Average pooling, on the other hand, is sensitive to spatial perturbations, but is a linear function. For semantic segmentation, we prefer both the preservation of detailed cues within a local feature region and non-linearity that increases a network's functional complexity.

To this end, we first observe several significant challenges. First, the target domain data is highly insufficient, making most existing domain adaptation methods ineffective. Second, object detection involves simultaneous localization and classification, further complicating the model adaptation process. Third, the model suffers from over-adaptation (similar to overfitting when training with a few data example) and instability risk that may lead to degraded detection performance in the target domain. To address these challenges, we first introduce a pairing mechanism over source and target features to alleviate the issue of insufficient target domain samples. We then propose a bi-level module to adapt the source trained detector to the target domain: 1) the split pooling based image level adaptation module uniformly extracts and aligns paired local patch features over locations, with different scale and aspect ratio; 2) the instance level adaptation module semantically aligns paired object features while avoids inter-class confusion. Meanwhile, a source model feature regularization (SMFR) is applied to stabilize the adaptation process of the two modules. Combining these contributions gives a novel few-shot adaptive Faster-RCNN framework, termed FAFRCNN, which effectively adapts to target domain with a few labeled samples.

The first submodule, namely Noisy Weighting, can estimate the confidence scores of all the images in the noisy subset, by analyzing their deep features jointly. The second submodule, namely Clean Hallucinating, can generate a clean representation from the noisy subset, by summarizing the noisy images with their confidence scores. Via MetaCleaner, DNNs can strengthen its robustness to noisy labels, as well as enhance its generalization capacity with richer data diversity. Moreover, MetaCleaner can be easily integrated into the standard training procedure of DNNs, which promotes its value for real-life applications. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks in noisy-labeled recognition, i.e., Food-101N and Clothing1M. For both datasets, our MetaCleaner significantly outperforms baselines, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.", "title": "MetaCleaner: Learning to Hallucinate Clean Representations for Noisy-Labeled Visual Recognition"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Thoma_Mapping_Localization_and_Path_Planning_for_Image-Based_Navigation_Using_Visual_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "Building on progress in feature representations for image retrieval, image-based localization has seen a surge of research interest. Image-based localization has the advantage of being inexpensive and efficient, often avoiding the use of 3D metric maps altogether. That said, the need to maintain a large amount of reference images as an effective support of localization in a scene, nonetheless calls for them to be organized in a map structure of some kind. The problem of localization often arises as part of a navigation process. We are, therefore, interested in summarizing the reference images as a set of landmarks, which meet the requirements for image-based navigation. A contribution of this paper is to formulate such a set of requirements for the two sub-tasks involved: compact map construction and accurate self localization. These requirements are then exploited for compact map representation and accurate self-localization, using the framework of a network flow problem. During this process, we formulate the map construction and self-localization problems as convex quadratic and second-order cone programs, respectively.

An initial attempt towards this goal is to simply share a single network for multi-task learning. We argue that it does not make full use of the fact that detection and segmentation are mutually beneficial. In this paper, we propose a framework called TripleNet to deeply boost these two tasks. On the one hand, to deeply join the two tasks at different scales, triple supervisions including detection-oriented supervision and class-aware/agnostic segmentation supervisions are imposed on each layer of the decoder. Class-agnostic segmentation provides an objectness prior to detection and segmentation. On the other hand, to further intercross the two tasks and refine the features in each scale, two light-weight modules (i.e., the inner-connected module and the attention skip-layer fusion) are incorporated. Because segmentation supervision on each decoder layer are not performed at the test stage and two added modules are light-weight, the proposed TripleNet can run at a real-time speed (16 fps). Experiments on the VOC 2007/2012 and COCO datasets show that TripleNet outperforms all the other one-stage methods on both two tasks (e.g., 81.9% mAP and 83.3% mIoU on VOC 2012, and 37.1% mAP and 59.6% mIoU on COCO) by a single network.", "title": "Triply Supervised Decoder Networks for Joint Detection and Segmentation"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Li_Leveraging_the_Invariant_Side_of_Generative_Zero-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "Conventional zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods generally learn an embedding, e.g., visual-semantic mapping, to handle the unseen visual samples via an indirect manner.

Specifically, we train a conditional Wasserstein GANs in which the generator synthesizes fake unseen features from noises and the discriminator distinguishes the fake from real via a minimax game.

A soul sample is the meta-representation of one class. It visualizes the most semantically-meaningful aspects of each sample in the same category. We regularize that each generated sample (the varying side of generative ZSL) should be close to at least one soul sample (the invariant side) which has the same class label with it.

In this work we seek to improve our understanding of this phenomenon, in part by pursuing an opposite approach. Instead of attempting to improve detection scores by employing context, we treat the utility of context as an optimization problem: to what extent can detection scores be improved by considering context or any other kind of additional information? With this approach we explore the bounds on improvement by using contextual relations between objects and provide a tool for identifying the most helpful ones. We show that simple co-occurrence relations can often provide large gains, while in other cases a significant improvement is simply impossible or impractical with either co-occurrence or more precise spatial relations. To better understand these results we then analyze the ability of context to handle different types of false detections, revealing that tested contextual information cannot ameliorate localization errors, severely limiting its gains.

In particular, Graphonomy first learns and propagates compact high-level graph representation among the labels within one dataset via Intra-Graph Reasoning, and then transfers semantic information across multiple datasets via Inter-Graph Transfer. Various graph transfer dependencies (e.g., similarity, linguistic knowledge) between different datasets are analyzed and encoded to enhance graph transfer capability.

Compressing the 3D models used for localization thus becomes a practical necessity. In this work, we introduce a new hybrid compression algorithm that uses a given memory limit in a more effective way. Rather than treating all 3D points equally, it represents a small set of points with full appearance information and an additional, larger set of points with compressed information.

This limits the usage of two-stream approaches in real-world applications requiring low latency. In this paper, we introduce two learning approaches to train a standard 3D CNN, operating on RGB frames, that mimics the motion stream, and as a result avoids flow computation at test time.  First, by minimizing a feature-based loss compared to the Flow stream, we show that the network reproduces the motion stream with high fidelity.  Second, to leverage both appearance and motion information effectively, we train with a linear combination of the feature-based loss and the standard cross-entropy loss for action recognition. We denote the stream trained using this combined loss as Motion-Augmented RGB Stream (MARS). As a single stream, MARS performs better than RGB or Flow alone, for instance with 72.7% accuracy on Kinetics compared to 72.0% and 65.6% with RGB and Flow streams respectively.", "title": "MARS: Motion-Augmented RGB Stream for Action Recognition"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Azar_Convolutional_Relational_Machine_for_Group_Activity_Recognition_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "We present an end-to-end deep Convolutional Neural Network called Convolutional Relational Machine (CRM) for recognizing group activities that utilizes the information in spatial relations between individual persons in image or video.

Compared to previous solutions, C-RPN has several advantages: (1) Each RPN is trained using the outputs of RPN in the previous stage. Such process stimulates hard negative sampling, resulting in more balanced training samples. Consequently, the RPNs are sequentially more discriminative in distinguishing difficult background (i.e.,, similar distractors). (2) Multi-level features are fully leveraged through a novel feature transfer block (FTB) for each RPN, further improving the discriminability of C-RPN using both high-level semantic and low-level spatial information. (3) With multiple steps of regressions, C-RPN progressively refines the location and shape of the target in each RPN with adjusted anchor boxes in the previous stage, which makes localization more accurate. C-RPN is trained end-to-end with the multi-task loss function. In inference, C-RPN is deployed as it is, without any temporal adaption, for real-time tracking.

Therefore, inspired by the successful application of context to object-oriented tasks, we especially construct context for relationships where all of them are gathered so that the recognition could benefit from their association. Moreover, accurate recognition needs discriminative visual pattern for object, and so does relationship. In order to discover effective pattern for relationship, traditional relationship feature extraction methods such as using union region or combination of subject-object feature pairs are replaced with our proposed intersection region which focuses on more essential parts.

We propose a method to quantify the sensitivity of black-box vision models to visual context by editing images to remove selected objects and measuring the response of the target models. We apply this methodology on two tasks, image classification and semantic segmentation, and discover undesirable dependency between objects and context, for example that \"sidewalk\" segmentation is very sensitive to the presence of \"cars\" in the image.

One promising direction to achieve fairness is by learning data representations that remove the semantics of protected characteristics, and are therefore able to mitigate unfair outcomes. All available models however learn latent embeddings which comes at the cost of being uninterpretable. We propose to cast this problem as data-to-data translation, i.e. learning a mapping from an input domain to a fair target domain, where a fairness definition is being enforced. Here the data domain can be images, or any tabular data representation. This task would be straightforward if we had fair target data available, but this is not the case. To overcome this, we learn a highly unconstrained mapping by exploiting statistics of residuals -- the difference between input data and its translated version -- and the protected characteristics. When applied to the CelebA dataset of face images with gender attribute as the protected characteristic, our model enforces equality of opportunity by adjusting the eyes and lips regions. Intriguingly, on the same dataset we arrive at similar conclusions when using semantic attribute representations of images for translation. On face images of the recent DiF dataset, with the same gender attribute, our method adjusts nose regions. In the Adult income dataset, also with protected gender attribute, our model achieves equality of opportunity by, among others, obfuscating the wife and husband relationship.

For example, when the graphs are detected perfectly, XNMs achieve 100% accuracy on both CLEVR and CLEVR CoGenT, establishing an empirical performance upper-bound for visual reasoning; when the graphs are noisily detected from real-world images, XNMs are still robust to achieve a competitive 67.5% accuracy on VQAv2.0, surpassing the popular bag-of-objects attention models without graph structures.", "title": "Explainable and Explicit Visual Reasoning Over Scene Graphs"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Noh_Transfer_Learning_via_Unsupervised_Task_Discovery_for_Visual_Question_Answering_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "We study how to leverage off-the-shelf visual and linguistic data to cope with out-of-vocabulary answers in visual question answering task.

The CGO constrains the model to involve a human-concerned object when the object is in the image. CGO ensures that the object is in the generated description while maintaining fluency. Instead of generating the sequence from left to right, we start the description with a selected object and generate other parts of the sequence based on this object. To achieve this, we design a novel framework combining two LSTMs in opposite directions.

Our framework addresses the identification and localization of the occurring stitch types, which is challenging due to huge appearance variations. The resulting coarsely localized stitch types are used to infer the underlying grid structure as well as for the extraction of the knitting instruction of pattern repeats, taking into account principles of Gestalt theory. Finally, the derived instructions allow the reproduction of the knitting structures, either as renderings or by actual knitting, as demonstrated in several examples.", "title": "Inverse Procedural Modeling of Knitwear"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Li_Estimating_3D_Motion_and_Forces_of_Person-Object_Interactions_From_Monocular_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a method to automatically reconstruct the 3D motion of a person interacting with an object from a single RGB video.

Our key novelty is that \"training\" these DNNs with properly defined unsupervised losses is equivalent to solving the underlying registration problem, but less sensitive to good initialization than ICP. Our framework contains two DNNs: a localization network that estimates the poses for input point clouds, and a map network that models the scene structure by estimating the occupancy status of global coordinates. This allows us to convert the registration problem to a binary occupancy classification, which can be solved efficiently using gradient-based optimization. We further show that DeepMapping can be readily extended to address the problem of Lidar SLAM by imposing geometric constraints between consecutive point clouds.

Shape2Motion is comprised of two deep neural networks designed for mobility proposal generation and mobility optimization, respectively. The key contribution of these networks is the novel motion-driven features and losses used in both motion part segmentation and motion attribute estimation. This is based on the observation that the movement of a functional part preserves the shape structure. We evaluate Shape2Motion with a newly proposed benchmark for mobility analysis of 3D shapes.

By applying differencing operations appropriately, we may turn time-variant polynomials into a constant, making the deterministic component predictable.

Recent works try to encode relation by constructing graphs, e.g. using handcraft linguistic knowledge between classes or implicitly learning a fully-connected graph between regions.

Unfortunately, the existing VQA approaches do not consider the facts that: 1) Observers only see viewports of 360deg video, rather than patches or whole 360deg frames. 2) Within the viewport, only salient regions can be perceived by observers with high resolution. Thus, this paper proposes a viewport-based convolutional neural network (V-CNN) approach for VQA on 360deg video, considering both auxiliary tasks of viewport proposal and viewport saliency prediction. Our V-CNN approach is composed of two stages, i.e., viewport proposal and VQA. In the first stage, the viewport proposal network (VP-net) is developed to yield several potential viewports, seen as the first auxiliary task. In the second stage, a viewport quality network (VQ-net) is designed to rate the VQA score for each proposed viewport, in which the saliency map of the viewport is predicted and then utilized in VQA score rating. Consequently, another auxiliary task of viewport saliency prediction can be achieved. More importantly, the main task of VQA on 360deg video can be accomplished via integrating the VQA scores of all viewports. The experiments validate the effectiveness of our V-CNN approach in significantly advancing the state-of-the-art performance of VQA on 360deg video.

This article attempts to answer these questions by analyzing the representations learned by individual neurons located at the intermediate layers of deep saliency models. To this end, we follow the steps of existing deep saliency models, that is borrowing a pre-trained model of object recognition to encode the visual features and learning a decoder to infer the saliency. We consider two cases when the encoder is used as a fixed feature extractor and when it is fine-tuned, and compare the inner representations of the network. To study how the learned representations depend on the task, we fine-tune the same network using the same image set but for two different tasks: saliency prediction versus scene classification. Our analyses reveal that: 1) some visual regions (e.g. head, text, symbol, vehicle) are already encoded within various layers of the network pre-trained for object recognition, 2) using modern datasets, we find that fine-tuning pre-trained models for saliency prediction makes them favor some categories (e.g. head) over some others (e.g. text), 3) although deep models of saliency outperform classical models on natural images, the converse is true for synthetic stimuli (e.g. pop-out search arrays), an evidence of significant difference between human and data-driven saliency models, and 4) we confirm that, after-fine tuning, the change in inner-representations is mostly due to the task and not the domain shift in the data", "title": "Understanding and Visualizing Deep Visual Saliency Models"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Zhang_Divergence_Prior_and_Vessel-Tree_Reconstruction_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "We propose a new geometric regularization principle for reconstructing vector fields based on prior knowledge about their divergence.

Intuitively, we humans use the inductive bias to compose collocations and contextual inference in discourse. For example, when we see the relation \"person on bike\", it is natural to replace \"on\" with \"ride\" and infer \"person riding bike on a road\" even the \"road\" is not evident. Therefore, exploiting such bias as a language prior is expected to help the conventional encoder-decoder models less likely to overfit to the dataset bias and focus on reasoning. Specifically, we use the scene graph --- a directed graph (G) where an object node is connected by adjective nodes and relationship nodes --- to represent the complex structural layout of both image (I) and sentence (S). In the textual domain, we use SGAE to learn a dictionary (D) that helps to reconstruct sentences in the S -> G -> D -> S pipeline, where D encodes the desired language prior; in the vision-language domain, we use the shared D to guide the encoder-decoder in the I -> G -> D -> S pipeline. Thanks to the scene graph representation and shared dictionary, the inductive bias is transferred across domains in principle. We validate the effectiveness of SGAE on the challenging MS-COCO image captioning benchmark, e.g., our SGAE-based single-model achieves a new state-of-the-art 127.8 CIDEr-D on the Karpathy split, and a competitive 125.5 CIDEr-D (c40) on the official server even compared to other ensemble models.

To explore this idea, we introduce DensePose-Track, a dataset of videos where selected frames are annotated in the traditional DensePose manner. Then, building on geometric properties of the DensePose mapping, we use the video dynamic to propagate ground-truth annotations in time as well as to learn from Siamese equivariance constraints. Having performed exhaustive empirical evaluation of various data annotation and learning strategies, we demonstrate that doing so can deliver significantly improved pose estimation results over strong baselines. However, despite what is suggested by some recent works, we show that merely synthesizing motion patterns by applying geometric transformations to isolated frames is significantly less effective, and that motion cues help much more when they are extracted from videos.", "title": "Slim DensePose: Thrifty Learning From Sparse Annotations and Motion Cues"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Li_Self-Supervised_Representation_Learning_From_Videos_for_Facial_Action_Unit_Detection_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "In this paper, we aim to learn discriminative representation for facial action unit (AU) detection from large amount of videos without manual annotations.

However, under the uncontrolled condition, the transformation is caused by both facial actions and head motions. To remove the influence by head motions, we propose a Twin-Cycle Autoencoder (TCAE) that can disentangle the facial action related movements and the head motion related ones. Specifically, TCAE is trained to respectively change the facial actions and head poses of the source face to those of the target face.

However, the current works seldom consider the problem of incoherent deformation caused by landmarks. In this paper, we explicitly formulate the deformation as locally rigid motions guided by some seed points, and the formulated deformation satisfies coherent local motions everywhere on a face. The seed points are initialized by a few landmarks, and are then augmented to boost shape matching between the template and the target face step by step, to finally achieve dense correspondence.

However, they are notoriously sensitive to small changes in the input. Most CNNs trained to describe image-to-image mappings generate temporally unstable results when applied to video sequences, leading to flickering artifacts and other inconsistencies over time. In order to use CNNs for video material, previous methods have relied on estimating dense frame-to-frame motion information (optical flow) in the training and/or the inference phase, or by exploring recurrent learning structures. We take a different approach to the problem, posing temporal stability as a regularization of the cost function. The regularization is formulated to account for different types of motion that can occur between frames, so that temporally stable CNNs can be trained without the need for video material or expensive motion estimation. The training can be performed as a fine-tuning operation, without architectural modifications of the CNN. Our evaluation shows that the training strategy leads to large improvements in temporal smoothness. Moreover, for small datasets the regularization can help in boosting the generalization performance to a much larger extent than what is possible with naive augmentation strategies.", "title": "Single-Frame Regularization for Temporally Stable CNNs"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Goel_An_End-To-End_Network_for_Generating_Social_Relationship_Graphs_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "Socially-intelligent agents are of growing interest in artificial intelligence.

The key idea of ECC is to model the DNN energy consumption via a novel bilinear regression function. The energy estimate model allows us to formulate DNN compression as a constrained optimization that minimizes the DNN loss function over the energy constraint. The optimization problem, however, has nontrivial constraints. Therefore, existing deep learning solvers do not apply directly. We propose an optimization algorithm that combines the essence of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework with gradient-based learning algorithms.

In the first stage, we learn disentangled representations by a one-versus-rest disentangle learning (OVRDL) mechanism. In the second stage, we improve the disentanglement by an additive adversarial learning (AAL) mechanism. Moreover, we discuss the necessity to avoid a learning dilemma due to disentangling causally related types of domain-difference.

To address this issue, recent progress in cross-domain recognition has featured the Mean Teacher, which directly simulates unsupervised domain adaptation as semi-supervised learning. The domain gap is thus naturally bridged with consistency regularization in a teacher-student scheme. In this work, we advance this Mean Teacher paradigm to be applicable for cross-domain detection. Specifically, we present Mean Teacher with Object Relations (MTOR) that novelly remolds Mean Teacher under the backbone of Faster R-CNN by integrating the object relations into the measure of consistency cost between teacher and student modules. Technically, MTOR firstly learns relational graphs that capture similarities between pairs of regions for teacher and student respectively. The whole architecture is then optimized with three consistency regularizations: 1) region-level consistency to align the region-level predictions between teacher and student, 2) inter-graph consistency for matching the graph structures between teacher and student, and 3) intra-graph consistency to enhance the similarity between regions of same class within the graph of student.

Are image features trained with samples of seen classes expressive enough to capture the discriminative information for both seen and unseen classes? Is the relationship learned from seen image features and attributes sufficiently generalized to recognize unseen classes.

In this paper, we propose to learn the neuron allocation for aggregating multi-scale information in different building blocks of a deep network. The most informative output neurons in each block are preserved while others are discarded, and thus neurons for multiple scales are competitively and adaptively allocated. Our scale aggregation network (ScaleNet) is constructed by repeating a scale aggregation (SA) block that concatenates feature maps at a wide range of scales. Feature maps for each scale are generated by a stack of downsampling, convolution and upsampling operations. The data-driven neuron allocation and SA block achieve strong representational power at the cost of considerably low computational complexity.

In doing so, our contributions are threefold:(i) we design our gaze redirection framework from synthetic data, allowing us to benefit from aligned training sample pairs to predict accurate inverse mapping fields; (ii) we proposed a self-supervised approach for domain adaptation; (iii) we exploit the gaze redirection to improve the performance of person-specific gaze estimation. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the validity of our gaze retargeting and gaze estimation framework.", "title": "Improving Few-Shot User-Specific Gaze Adaptation via Gaze Redirection Synthesis"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Liu_AdaptiveFace_Adaptive_Margin_and_Sampling_for_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "Training large-scale unbalanced data is the central topic in face recognition. In the past two years, face recognition has achieved remarkable improvements due to the introduction of margin based Softmax loss. However, these methods have an implicit assumption that all the classes possess sufficient samples to describe its distribution, so that a manually set margin is enough to equally squeeze each intra-class variations. However, real face datasets are highly unbalanced, which means the classes have tremendously different numbers of samples. In this paper, we argue that the margin should be adapted to different classes. We propose the Adaptive Margin Softmax to adjust the margins for different classes adaptively. In addition to the unbalance challenge, face data always consists of large-scale classes and samples. Smartly selecting valuable classes and samples to participate in the training makes the training more effective and efficient. To this end, we also make the sampling process adaptive in two folds: Firstly, we propose the Hard Prototype Mining to adaptively select a small number of hard classes to participate in classification. Secondly, for data sampling, we introduce the Adaptive Data Sampling to find valuable samples for training adaptively. We combine these three parts together as AdaptiveFace.

State-of-the-art methods not only struggle with such scenarios, but are often too resource intensive for certain real-time applications. In this paper we propose HF-Net, a hierarchical localization approach based on a monolithic CNN that simultaneously predicts local features and global descriptors for accurate 6-DoF localization. We exploit the coarse-to-fine localization paradigm: we first perform a global retrieval to obtain location hypotheses and only later match local features within those candidate places. This hierarchical approach incurs significant runtime savings and makes our system suitable for real-time operation. By leveraging learned descriptors, our method achieves remarkable localization robustness across large variations of appearance and sets a new state-of-the-art on two challenging benchmarks for large-scale localization.", "title": "From Coarse to Fine: Robust Hierarchical Localization at Large Scale"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Robinson_Large_Scale_High-Resolution_Land_Cover_Mapping_With_Multi-Resolution_Data_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "In this paper we propose multi-resolution data fusion methods for deep learning-based high-resolution land cover mapping from aerial imagery. The land cover mapping problem, at country-level scales, is challenging for common deep learning methods due to the scarcity of high-resolution labels, as well as variation in geography and quality of input images. On the other hand, multiple satellite imagery and low-resolution ground truth label sources are widely available, and can be used to improve model training efforts. Our methods include: introducing low-resolution satellite data to smooth quality differences in high-resolution input, exploiting low-resolution labels with a dual loss function, and pairing scarce high-resolution labels with inputs from several points in time. We train models that are able to generalize from a portion of the Northeast United States, where we have high-resolution land cover labels, to the rest of the US. With these models, we produce the first high-resolution (1-meter) land cover map of the contiguous US, consisting of over 8 trillion pixels. We demonstrate the robustness and potential applications of this data in a case study with domain experts and develop a web application to share our results. This work is practically useful, and can be applied to other locations over the earth as high-resolution imagery becomes more widely available even as high-resolution labeled land cover data remains sparse.", "title": "Large Scale High-Resolution Land Cover Mapping With Multi-Resolution Data"}, {"url": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Zhao_Leveraging_Heterogeneous_Auxiliary_Tasks_to_Assist_Crowd_Counting_CVPR_2019_paper.html", "abstract": "Crowd counting is a challenging task in the presence of drastic scale variations, the clutter background, and severe occlusions, etc. Existing CNN-based counting methods tackle these challenges mainly by fusing either multi-scale or multi-context features to generate robust representations. In this paper, we propose to address these issues by leveraging the heterogeneous attributes compounded in the density map. We identify three geometric/semantic/numeric attributes essentially important to the density estimation, and demonstrate how to effectively utilize these heterogeneous attributes to assist the crowd counting by formulating them into multiple auxiliary tasks. With the multi-fold regularization effects induced by the auxiliary tasks, the backbone CNN model is driven to embed desired properties explicitly and thus gains robust representations towards more accurate density estimation. Extensive experiments on three challenging crowd counting datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "title": "Leveraging Heterogeneous Auxiliary Tasks to Assist Crowd Counting"}]
