If the seller is allowed to use the full power of dynamic mechanism design and have the auction for each item depend on the outcome of the previous auctions, he is able to perform much better. The main issues in implementing such strategies in online settings where items arrive over time are that the auction might be too complicated or it makes too strong assumptions on the buyer's rationality or seller's commitment over time. This motivates us to explore a restricted family of dynamic auctions that can be implemented in an online fashion and without too much commitment from the seller ahead of time. In particular, we study a set of auction in which the space of single-shot auctions is augmented with a structure that we call bank account, a real number for each node that summarizes the history so far. This structure allows the seller to store deficits or surpluses of buyer utility from each individual auction and even them out on the long run. This is akin to enforcing individual rationality constraint on average rather than per auction. We also study the effect of enforcing a maximum limit to the values that bank account might grow, which means that we enforce that besides the auction being individually rational on average it is also not far from being individually rational at any given interval.

To remain coordinated and avoid conflicts, team members need to identify dependencies between their activities \u2014 which though loosely coupled may interact \u2014 and share information appropriately. The loose-coupling of tasks increases the difficulty of identifying dependencies, with the result that team members often lack important information or are overwhelmed by irrelevant information. This paper formalizes a new multi-agent systems problem, Information Sharing in Loosely-Coupled Extended-Duration Teamwork (ISLET). It defines a new representation, Mutual Influence Potential Networks (MIP-Nets) and an algorithm, MIP-DOI, that uses this representation to determine the information that is most relevant to each team member. Importantly, because the extended duration of the teamwork precludes team-members developing complete plans in advance, the MIP-Nets approach, unlike prior work on information sharing, does not rely on a priori knowledge of a team's possible plans. Instead, it models collaboration patterns and dependencies among people and their activities based on team-members' interactions.

By multiplying the unstable component with a weight matrix on the right side, we obtain a weighted-least-square transition matrix that is further optimized to minimize the reconstruction error of the state sequence while still maintaining the stable constraint.

To offer a robust method, we propose a novel supervised model, called PALE, which employs network embedding with awareness of observed anchor links as supervised information to capture the major and specific structural regularities and further learns a stable cross-network mapping for predicting anchor links.

In this paper, we propose a training strategy, ACQUEST (ACtive QUErying STrong modalities), which exploits strong modal information by actively querying the strong modal feature values of \"selected\" instances rather than their corresponding ground truths. In ACQUEST, only the informative instances are selected for strong modal feature acquisition. An inverse prediction technique is also proposed to make the ACQUEST a unified optimization form.

Previous works on EHR-based phenotyping utilized unsupervised and supervised learning methods separately by independently detecting phenotypes and predicting medical risk scores. To improve EHR-based phenotyping by bridging the separated methods, we present Bayesian nonparametric collaborative topic Poisson factorization (BN-CTPF) that is the first nonparametric content-based Poisson factorization and first application of jointly analyzing the phenotye topics and estimating the individual risk scores. BN-CTPF shows better performances in predicting the risk scores when we compared the model with previous matrix factorization and topic modeling methods including a Poisson factorization and its collaborative extensions.

While householder's daily energy usage behavior acts as one powerful cue for breaking down the entire household's energy consumption, existing works rarely modeled it straightforwardly. Instead, they either ignored the influence between users' energy usage behaviors, or modeled the influence between the energy usages of appliances.With ambiguous appliance usage membership of householders, we find it difficult to appropriately model the influence between appliances, since such influence is determined by human behaviors in energy usage. To address this problem, we propose to model the influence between householders' energy usage behaviors directly through a novel probabilistic model, which combines topic models with the Hawkes processes. The proposed model simultaneously disaggregates the whole home electricity signal into each component appliance and infers the appliance usage membership of household members, and enables those two tasks mutually benefit each other. Experimental results on both synthetic data and four real world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in not only decomposing the entire consumed energy to each appliance in houses, but also the inference of household structures.

We formulate this problem as a classification problem by characterizing each place through its fine-grained visiting patterns, which encode the visiting frequency of each user in each typical time slot. However, with the incoming activities of new users in data streams, such fine-grained visiting patterns constantly grow, leading to a continuously expanding feature space.

By traversing between heterogeneous networks through overlapping entities, AmpSim can easily gather side information from other networks and capture the rich similarity semantics between entities. We further incorporate the similarity information captured by AmpSim in a collective matrix factorization model such that the transferred knowledge can be iteratively propagated across networks to fit the emerging business.

A DES model represents state dynamics in a discrete manner. Given a flow of observable events generated by a DES model, diagnosis aims at deciding whether a system is running normally or is experiencing faulty behaviors. The main challenge is to deal with the complexity of a diagnosis problem, which has to monitor an observation flow on the fly and generate a succession of the states that the system is possibly in, called belief state. Previous work has proposed exact diagnosis, which attempts to compute a belief state at any time consistent with the observation flow from the time when the system starts operating to the current time. The main drawback is the inability to follow the observation flow for a large system because the size of each belief state has been proved to be exponential in the number of system states. Furthermore, the temporal complexity to handle the exact belief states remains a problem. Because diagnosis of DES is a hard problem, the use of faster diagnostic algorithms that do not perform an exact diagnosis is often inevitable. However, those algorithms may not be as precise as an exact model-based diagnostic algorithm to diagnose a diagnosable system. This work has four contributions. First, it proposes to verify the precision of an imprecise diagnostic algorithm w.r.t. a diagnosable DES model by constructing a simulation, which is a finite state machine that represents how a diagnostic algorithm works for a DES model. Second, this work proposes window-based diagnostic algorithms, called Independent-Window Algorithms (IWAs). IWAs only diagnose on the very last events of the observation flow and forget about the past. Third, this work proposes a compromise between the two extreme strategies of exact diagnosis and IWAs by looking for the minimum piece of information to remember from the past so that a window-based algorithm ensures the same precision as using the exact diagnosis. This work proposes Time-Window Algorithms (TWAs), which are extensions to IWAs. TWAs carry over some information about the current system state from one time window to the next. Fourth, this work evaluates IWAs and TWAs through experiments and compares their performance with the exact diagnosis encoded by Binary Decision Diagrams. This work also examines the impact of the time window selections on the performance of IWAs and TWAs.", "title": "Time Decomposition for Diagnosis of Discrete Event Systems (Extended Abstract)"}, {"url": "https://www.ijcai.org/Abstract/16/590", "abstract": "Short-texts accentuate the challenges posed by the high feature space dimensionality of text learning tasks.

To address this, we show how relaxed plan heuristics can be lifted to a variable-free first-order planning language, Functional STRIPS, where atomic formulas can involve arbitrary terms. The key idea is to regard the set of atoms that are reachable in a propositional layer of the relaxed planning graph as encoding a set of logical first-order interpretations. A preconditionor goal formula is then regarded as reachable in a propositional layer, potentially adding new atoms to the next layer, when the set of atoms in the layer makes the formula satisfiable according to the rules of first-order logic.

However, to date it has been difficult to compare and contrast their capabilities in any controlled way. The main goal of the Robot Scavenger Hunt is to provide a standardized framework that includes a set of standardized tasks for evaluating the AI and robotic capabilities of medium-sized intelligent mobile robots. Compared to existing benchmarks, e.g., RoboCup@Home, Robot Scavenger Hunt aims at evaluations in larger spaces (multi-floor buildings vs. rooms) over longer periods of time (hours vs.minutes) while interacting with real human residents.", "title": "Robot Scavenger Hunt: A Standardized Framework for Evaluating Intelligent Mobile Robots"}]
