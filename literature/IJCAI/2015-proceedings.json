We introduce an optimal elicitation strategy that decides, at every stage of the negotiation, how much additional user information to extract at a certain cost.

A (multiagent) protocol defines the relevant social states and how they progress; each participant maintains a local projection of these states and acts accordingly. Protocols expose two important challenges: (1) how to compose them in a way that respects commitments and (2) how to verify the compliance of the parties with the social states. Individually, these challenges are inadequately studied and together not at all. We motivate the notion of a social context to capture how a protocol may be enacted. A protocol can be verifiably enacted when its participants can determine each other's compliance. We first show the negative result that even when protocols can be verifiably enacted in respective social contexts, their composition cannot be verifiably enacted in the composition of those social contexts. We next show how to expand such a protocol so that it can be verifiably enacted. Our approach involves design rules to specify composite protocols so they would be verifiably enactable.

First, we show that, whenever there are at least five alternatives, every Pareto-optimal majoritarian voting rule suffers from the no-show paradox with respect to Fishburn's extension.

Implicit semantics, however, are insufficient in supporting text or natural language based interfaces, which are adopted by an increasing number of applications. Indeed, in applications ranging from automatic ontology construction to question answering, explicit representation of semantics is starting to play a more prominent role. In this paper, we introduce the task of conceptual labeling (CL), which aims at generating a minimum set of conceptual labels that best summarize a bag of words. We draw the labels from a data driven semantic network that contains millions of highly connected concepts. The semantic network provides meaning to the concepts, and in turn, it provides meaning to the bag of words through the conceptual labels we generate. To achieve our goal, we use an information theoretic approach to trade-off the semantic coverage of a bag of words against the minimality of the output labels. Specifically, we use Minimum Description Length (MDL) as the criteria in selecting the best concepts.

A word-sense disambiguation algorithm is used to select the appropriate wikipage for each topical friend. Starting from the set of wikipages representing \"primitive\" interests, we extract all paths connecting these pages with topmost Wikipedia category nodes, and we then prune the resulting graph G efficiently so as to induce a direct acyclic graph. This graph is the Twixonomy. Then, to analyze homophily, we compare different methods to detect communities in a peer friends Twitter network, and then for each community we compute the degree of homophily on the basis of a measure of pairwise semantic similarity.We show that the Twixonomy provides a means for describing users' interests in a compact and readable way and allows for a fine-grained homophily analysis.

Although there are a number of quality estimation efforts on the CQA platform, most of these works focus on identifying and reducing low-quality answers, which are mostly generated by impatient or inexperienced answerers. However, a large number of promotion answers appear to provide high-quality information to cheat CQA users in future interactions. Therefore, most existing quality estimation works in CQA may fail to detect these specially designed answers or question-answer pairs. In contrast to these works, we focus on the promotion channels of spammers, which include (shortened) URLs, telephone numbers and social media accounts. Spammers rely on these channels to connect to users to achieve promotion goals so they are irreplaceable for spamming activities. We propose a propagation algorithm to diffuse promotion intents on an \"answerer-channel\" bipartite graph and detect possible spamming activities. A supervised learning framework is also proposed to identify whether a QA pair is spam based on propagated promotion intents.

In this algorithm, clustering process is separated into two parts. In one part, feature\u2019s weight is fine-tuned to make cluster partition meet an optimization function.

In this paper, we propose a novel class of logic programs whose evaluation always terminates. The proposed technique identifies terminating programs that are not captured by any of the current approaches. Our technique is based on the idea of measuring the size of terms and atoms to check whether the rule head size is bounded by the body, and performs a more fine-grained analysis than previous work. Rather than adopting an all-or-nothing approach (either we can say that the program is terminating or we cannot say anything), our technique can identify arguments that are \"limited'' (i.e., where there is no infinite propagation of terms) even when the program is not entirely recognized as terminating. Identifying arguments that are limited can support the user in the problem formulation and help other techniques that use limited arguments as a starting point. Another useful feature of our approach is that it is able to leverage external information about limited arguments.

To achieve that, there are a great number of artificial satellites orbiting Earth, equipped with high-resolution optical instruments and communicating with a network of ground stations. A satellite is said to be agile when it is able to move quickly around its gravity center along its three axes while moving along its orbit, thanks to gyroscopic actuators. It is equipped with a body-mounted optical instrument. To observe a ground area with the instrument, the satellite must be pointed to it. In practice, users submit observation requests to a mission center, which builds activity plans which are sent to the satellites. These plans contain several types of actions such as orbital maneuvers, acquisition realisations and acquisition downloads towards ground stations. Many techniques are used to synthesize such activity plans. Until now, plans are computed offline on the ground and converted into telecommands that the satellite executes strictly, without any flexibility. However, the satellite evolves in a dynamic environment. Unexpected events occur, such as meteorological changes or new urgent observation requests, that the system must handle. Moreover, resource consumption is not always well known. Until now, to ensure that plans will be executable on board with these uncertainties, they are built with worst-case hypothesis on resources consumption. The objective of this work is to give more autonomy to the satellite without compromising the predictability that is needed for some activities. On the ground, we have high computing power and high uncertainty, while on board we have very low computing power and low uncertainty. The main idea is to share decision-making between ground and board to take advantage of the high computing power on the ground and of the low uncertainty on board.

These methods are very useful to model real world domains, where incompleteness and uncertainty are common. This combination has become a fundamental component of the Semantic Web.Our work started with the development of a probabilistic semantics for DL, called DISPONTE, that applies the distribution semantics to DLs. Under DISPONTE we annotate axioms of a theory with a probability, that can be interpreted as the degree of our belief in the corresponding axiom, and we assume that each axiom is independent of the others. Several algorithms have been proposed for supporting the development of the Semantic Web. Efficient DL reasoners, such us Pellet, are able to extract implicit information from the modeled ontologies. Despite the availability of many DL reasoners, the number of probabilistic reasoners is quite small. We developed BUNDLE, a reasoner based on Pellet that allows to compute the probability of queries. BUNDLE, like most DL reasoners, exploits an imperative language for implementing its reasoning algorithm. Nonetheless, usually reasoning algorithms use non-deterministic operators for doing inference. One of the most used approaches for doing reasoning is the tableau algorithm which applies a set of consistency preserving expansion rules to an ABox, but some of these rules are non-deterministic.In order to manage this non-determinism, we developed the system TRILL which performs inference over DISPONTE DLs. It implements the tableau algorithm in the declarative Prolog language, whose search strategy is exploited for taking into account the non-determinism of the reasoning process. Moreover, we developed a second version of TRILL, called TRILL^P, which implements some optimizations for reducing the running time. The parameters of probabilistic KBs are difficult to set. It is thus necessary to develop systems which automatically learn this parameters starting from the information available in the KB. We presented EDGE that learns the parameters of a DISPONTE KB, and LEAP, that learn the structure together with the parameters of a DISPONTE KB. The main objective is to apply the developed algorithms to Big Data. Nonetheless, the size of the data requires the implementation of algorithms able to handle it.
