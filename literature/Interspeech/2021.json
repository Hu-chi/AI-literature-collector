Researchers have attempted to\nresolve this problem by adding an ASR or other auxiliary supervision\nloss functions. In this study, we propose an unsupervised method called\nthe \u201cinformation sieve\u201d to reduce the effect of content\nleakage in prosody transfer. The rationale of this approach is that\nthe style encoder can be forced to focus on style information rather\nthan on textual information contained in the reference speech by a\nwell-designed downsample-upsample filter, i.e., the extracted style\nembeddings can be downsampled at a certain interval and then upsampled\nby duplication. Furthermore, we used instance normalization in convolution\nlayers to help the system learn a better latent style space. Objective\nmetrics such as the significantly lower word error rate (WER) demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of this model in mitigating content leakage.

This is achieved by exploiting\nthe smoothness properties of the pitch trajectory. That is, a recurrent\nneural network compensates delay introduced by the feature computation\nby predicting the pitch for a desired point, allowing a trade-off between\npitch accuracy and latency.\n  We integrate the pitch\nestimation in a speech enhancement framework for hearing aids. For\nthis application, we allow a delay on the analysis side of approx.\n5ms. The pitch estimate is then used for constructing a comb filter\nin frequency domain as post-processing step to remove intra-harmonic\nnoise.\n  Our pitch estimation performance is on par with SOTA algorithms\nlike PYIN or CREPE for spoken speech in all noise conditions while\nintroducing minimal latency.", "title": "LACOPE: Latency-Constrained Pitch Estimation for Speech Enhancement"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2021/fontaine21_interspeech.html", "abstract": "This paper proposes \u03b1-stable autoregressive fast multichannel\nnonnegative matrix factorization (\u03b1-AR-FastMNMF), a robust joint\nblind speech enhancement and dereverberation method for improved automatic\nspeech recognition in a realistic adverse environment.

With recent state-of-the-art attention-based\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) structure, NAR can realize promising\nreal-time factor (RTF) improvement with only small degradation of accuracy\ncompared to the autoregressive (AR) models. However, the recognition\ninference needs to wait for the completion of a full speech utterance,\nwhich limits their applications on low latency scenarios. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel end-to-end streaming NAR speech recognition\nsystem by combining blockwise-attention and connectionist temporal\nclassification with mask-predict (Mask-CTC) NAR. During inference,\nthe input audio is separated into small blocks and then processed in\na blockwise streaming way. To address the insertion and deletion error\nat the edge of the output of each block, we apply an overlapping decoding\nstrategy with a dynamic mapping trick that can produce more coherent\nsentences. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves\nonline ASR recognition in low latency conditions compared to vanilla\nMask-CTC. Moreover, it can achieve a much faster inference speed compared\nto the AR attention-based models.
