However the ASR problem is still far from being solved because not all information available in the speech knowledge hierarchy can be directly and effectively integrated into the current top-down knowledge integration framework in the state-of-the-art systems to improve ASR performance and enhance system robustness. It is believed that some of the current knowledge insufficiency issues can be partially addressed by processing techniques that can take advantage of the full set of acoustic and language information in speech. On the other hand in human speech recognition (HSR) and spectrogram reading we often determine the linguistic identity of a sound based on detected cues and evidences that exist at various levels of the speech knowledge hierarchy, ranging from acoustic phonetics to syntax and semantics. This calls for a bottom-up knowledge integration framework that links speech processing with information extraction, by spotting speech cues with a bank of attribute detectors, weighing and combining acoustic evidences to form cognitive hypotheses, and verifying these theories until a consistent recognition decision can be reached. The recently proposed ASAT (automatic speech attribute transcription) framework is an attempt to mimic some HSR capabilities with asynchronous speech event detection followed by bottom-up speech knowledge integration and verification. In the last few years it has demonstrated potentials and offered insights in detection-based speech processing and information extraction. This presentation is intended to illustrate new possibilities of speech research via linking analysis and processing of raw speech signals with extracting multiple layers of useful speech information. By organizing these probabilistic evidences from the speech knowledge hierarchy, and integrating them into the already-powerful, top-down HMM framework we can facilitate a knowledge-rich, bottom-up and data-driven framework that will lower the entry barriers to ASR research and further enhance the capabilities and reduce some of the limitations in the state-of-the-art ASR systems. Everyone in and out of the current ASR community will be able to contribute to this worthwhile effort to build a collaborative ASR community of the 21st Century.", "title": "An information-extraction approach to speech analysis and processing"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2012/dannenberg12_interspeech.html", "abstract": "Music understanding is the automatic recognition of pattern and structure in music.

These vocalizations are emitted at frequencies that exceed human hearing abilities. With the advent of digital recordings of these ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), there have been tremendous advances in our understanding of USV function. For instance, we now know that variations in predator threat elicit subtle differences in prairie dog alarm calls, which, in turn, engender predator-specific evasive behaviors. This model of referential communication (stimulus \u2192 vocalization \u2192 behavioral response) has also been employed to elucidate how emotional information is conveyed. For instance, rats and mice can learn that a tone predicts a stressful experience simply by hearing a companion rodent undergo this stressful contingency. These rodent studies have catalyzed new understanding of the neurobiological substrates of empathy. Rats also utilize different USV frequencies to indicate aggression versus affiliation. In turn, these USVs elicit different patterns of brain activity and behavioral responses of the rodents that hear these calls. These studies have opened new pathways to our understanding of rat psychological experience . what they prefer, what they find aversive. Mice also use different call patterns for different levels of social interaction.

The current study focused on the design of stationary spectral modifications whose effect is to reallocate speech energy across frequency bands. Frequency band weights were selected using a genetic algorithm-based optimisation procedure, with glimpse proportion as the objective intelligibility metric, for a range of noise types and levels. As expected, a clear dependence of noise type and global signal-to-noise ratio on energy reallocation was found. One unanticipated outcome was the consistent discovery of sparse, highly-selective spectral energy weightings, particularly in high noise conditions. In a subjective test using stationary noise and competing speech maskers, listeners were able to identify significantly more words in sentences as a result of spectral weighting, with increases of up to 15 percentage points.

Here, using multi-electrode surface recordings from the cortex of subjects engaged in a listening task with two simultaneous speakers, we demonstrate that population responses in non-primary human auditory cortex faithfully encode critical features of attended speech: speech spectrograms reconstructed based on cortical responses to the mixture of speakers reveal salient spectral and temporal features of the attended speaker, as if listening to that speaker alone. A simple classifier trained solely on examples of single speakers can decode both attended words and speaker identity. We find that task performance is well predicted by a rapid increase in attention-modulated neural selectivity across both local single- electrode and population-level cortical responses.

For evaluating the approach, a choice of open software (Brno University of Technology phone decoders, HTK, SRILM, LIBLINEAR and FoCal) was used, and experiments were carried out on the Arabic dialects of the 2011 NIST LRE database.

The proposed suprasegmental feature set is very low dimensional, and is derived from F0 and energy contours across the AG, as well as normalized duration of the syllables within each AG. A Random Forest back end classifier is used to combine AG level scores from GMM and Decision Tree models, producing nativeness scores at the utterance level. The proposed prosodic nativeness classifier achieves 83.3% accuracy for 2-AG utterances and 89.1% accuracy for 3-AG utterances, exceeding a baseline Gaussian Supervector system's performance by more than 10% absolute.

When no alignment between source and target side is provided with the training data, it is challenging to build a CRF system with state-of-the-art performance. In this work, we present an approach incorporating an M-to-N alignment as a hidden variable within a transducer-based implementation of CRFs. Including integrated estimation of transition penalties, it was possible to train a state-of-the-art hidden CRF system in reasonable time for an English grapheme-to-phoneme conversion task without using an external model to provide the alignment.", "title": "Hidden conditional random fields with M-to-N alignments for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2012/rosenberg12d_interspeech.html", "abstract": "Detecting and modeling proper phrasing from an input text string is an important aspect when producing synthesis that sounds intelligible and natural. Knowledge of proper phrase structure influences, e.g., the placement and length of pauses, and the realization of phrase-final boundary contours, both of which can have an effect in a listener's percepts ranging from naturalness to semantic interpretation. In this work, we look at modeling the occurrence, and types, of phrase breaks from purely textual features, paying close attention to how the performance of the systems generalizes in- and out-of-domain for corpora of various types (such as broadcast news, spontaneous speech, and synthesis databases), and as a function of various subsets of syntactical and lexical features investigated.", "title": "Phrase boundary assignment from text in multiple domains"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2012/minematsu12_interspeech.html", "abstract": "In Japanese, every content word has its own mora-based H/L pitch pattern when it is uttered isolatedly, called accent type. When reading out a written sentence, however, this lexical H/L pattern is often changed according to the context, known as word accent sandhi. In our previous work, an accent sandhi predictor was developed using CRF, and in this paper, the predictor is improved through feature engineering especially focusing on phrases including numerals and those including loanwords. This is because our previous work showed that the prediction performance was relatively low for those phrases. To optimize the features used for CRF, it is critical to take into account the mechanism of word accent sandhi. We review linguistic and technical literatures that attempted to characterize accent sandhi in the phrases including numerals and loanwords and, by reflecting these characteristics, the features are re-designed. Experiments show that the proposed predictor improved the performance relatively by 37% and 41%, respectively.", "title": "Improved prediction of Japanese word accent sandhi using CRF"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2012/toutios12_interspeech.html", "abstract": "This paper reports experiments in synthesizing VCV sequences with French unvoiced stop or fricative consonants, using a time-domain simulation of the vocal-tract system. The necessary dynamics of the vocal-tract shape are derived in two steps: first, time-varying parameters of an articulatory model are calculated automatically from electromagnetic articulography (EMA) data, using a method previously published by the first author; second, semi-automatic corrections are applied to properly account for consonantal events. Time-varying characteristics of the glottis are set using empirical rules. Friction noise is generated along the length of the whole vocal-tract instead of locally at the narrowest constriction. Spectrogams of satisfactory synthesis results are presented alongside those of real speech recorded simultaneously with the articulatory data.

The results indicate that the velum is lowered during the production of pharyngeals and that this overlaps on adjacent vowels. However, nasalance patterns on vowels suggest that nasality is greatest on the portion of the vowel opposite the actual pharyngeal. Examination of both oral and nasal airflow patterns on vowels indicates that actually oral airflow is increasing significantly towards the pharyngeal, due to extreme jaw lowering for this articulation, which accounts for the observed nasality patterns. This study highlights the importance of separating out the relative contribution of the oral and nasal tracts when investigating nasality patterns.", "title": "Nasality from Moroccan Arabic nasal and pharyngeal consonants: patterns of airflow and nasalance"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2012/delvaux12_interspeech.html", "abstract": "This paper provides a comparative gestural account of nasal vowels in Southern French (Marseille, Toulouse; France) and in Northern French (Liege, Tournai; Belgium).

There are two opposing findings about the correlation between coarticulation and hyperarticulation in the literature: first, that emphasis results in timing patterns which reduce coarticulation; second, that both increased hyperarticulation and increased coarticulation have been observed in words of similar lexical properties (i.e., words from dense phonological neighborhoods). The current study was designed to explore these correlations further. The results indicate that contrastively stressed words have less coarticulation and longer vowels and consonants than unstressed words; however, the neighborhood density patterns were maintained across stress conditions. We take these findings to suggest that contrastive stress is about duration whereas other (i.e., lexically conditioned) hyperarticulation is about explicit spectral reorganization.", "title": "Nasal coarticulation and contrastive stress"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2012/oliveira12b_interspeech.html", "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that, in addition to velopharyngeal coupling, lingual position may also change during production of phonemic nasal vowels. In order to investigate differences in oral articulation between European Portuguese (EP) nasal vowels and oral counterparts, imaging data (both static and real-time MRI) of several EP speakers (male and female) are used. Superimposition of outlines of the vocal tract profiles, semi-automatically extracted from MRI images, were used to compare the position of tongue and lips during nasal and oral vowel production. The results suggest that lingual and labial differences between nasal vowels and their oral counterparts are quite subtle in EP.

Nasalized (coarticulated) vowels were found to be closer in the F1-F2 acoustic vowel space than corresponding oral (non-coarticulated) vowels, indicating that contrast is reduced in the nasal vowel space, relative to the oral vowel space. With respect to perception, listeners are, perhaps unsurprisingly, more accurate in identifying oral vowels than nasalized vowels. Interestingly, however, while listeners take longer to identify nasalized vowels than oral vowels when they hear those vowels in isolation, this difference in processing time disappears when the nasalized and oral vowels are heard in lexical contexts. We take these findings to indicate that listeners compensate for nasal coarticulation, albeit sometimes incompletely, attributing the acoustic effects to their consonantal source, and that this compensation takes place instantaneously.", "title": "Acoustic and perceptual similarity in coarticulatorily nasalized vowels"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2012/rong12_interspeech.html", "abstract": "In this study, a speaker-adaptive articulatory model was constructed by fitting point-wise articulatory positions measured by Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) to the framework of Childer\u0081fs vocal tract model (2000) to customize the standard vocal tract model with speaker-dependent articulatory features. With the speaker-adaptive articulatory model, the area functions of oral and nasal vowel pairs (/a/, /i/, /u/) were simulated. The differences of area functions between oral and nasal vowels were decomposed into orthogonal modes (Story et al., 1998) to account for the primary articulatory changes related to nasalization.
