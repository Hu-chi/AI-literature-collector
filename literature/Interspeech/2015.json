Even the utterance of a single vowel sound, such as [o] or [i], requires the talker to coordinate gestures of the lip and tongue with gestures of the respiratory-laryngeal system, to combine the timbre properties of the vowel with a specific voice quality and a specific melodic pattern. The latter can be chosen from some set of morphemes that differentiate utterances, as in the English sentences Oh? versus Oh!, or from some set of tonemes that differentiate words, as in the Mandarin Chinese words y\u012b `one' versus y\u01d0 `ant'.   In either case, the utterance will have a kind of \u201csimultaneous compositionality\u201d that can be found also in the vocal communication systems of many other primates. Its importance for the human biosignal is evident in the fact that human infants begin to develop the capacity for it as soon as the larynx disengages from the nasopharynx at about 2 months. Of course, most of the words of all spoken languages have an even richer internal compositional structure that depends on the coordination of gestural complexes for contrasting timbre properties, to create a series of alternating consonant and vowel sounds, as in the \u201ccanonical\u201d CV syllable type that infants with normal hearing begin to produce between 6 and 8 months of age, or the even more complex rhythmic structures that are used to make words in many languages. The development of writing systems was the first technical innovation for modeling this property of \u201cserial compositionality\u201d that is shared by all human languages, as well as by the vocal communication systems of some other primates (such as those of many species of gibbon). The history of the Interspeech conference series is closely intertwined with many other important technical developments that have greatly increased our ability to model both types of compositionality. Now is a fruitful time to apply these more recent technical developments in a concerted way to achieve a better understanding of the emergence of compositionality in phylogeny and ontogeny.", "title": "The emergence of compositional structure in language evolution and development"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2015/sarikaya15_interspeech.html", "abstract": "We have long envisioned that one day computers will understand natural language and anticipate what we need and when we need it to proactively complete tasks on our behalf. As computers get smaller and more pervasive, how humans interact with them is becoming a crucial issue. Despite numerous attempts over the past 40 years to make language understanding an effective and robust natural user interface for computer interaction, success was limited and scoped to applications that are not particularly central to everyday use. However, advances in speech recognition and machine learning, coupled with the emergence of structured data served by content providers and increased computational power have broadened the application of natural language understanding to a wide spectrum of everyday tasks that are central to the user's productivity. We believe that as computers become smaller and more ubiquitous (eg wearable computers) and as the number of applications increases, both system-initiated and user initiated task completion across various applications and services will become indispensable for personal life management and work productivity.

A comprehensive understanding of the structural and functional organization of the brain is not only of great importance for basic science, but also for the development of new approaches that improve diagnosis and the treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases. With this mindset, the Human Brain Project (HBP) started its work in October 2013 with the aim of creating a European ICT infrastructure for neuroscience. The immense complexity of the brain, with its approximately 86 billion nerve cells, makes it essential to include modeling and simulation approaches, combined with methods of high performance computing (HPC), in order to analyze the organizational principles of the brain.   One of the central elements of the HBP is the Human Brain Atlas. It includes data from different aspects of brain organization, eg, cytoarchitectonics, fibre architecture, molecular architecture and results from fMRI studies revealing the functional segregation of the brain. Such multi-level atlas allows analyzing the neural underpinnings of language processes with unprecedented detail, and studying structural-functional relationships at the level of cortical areas.   Conversely, the understanding of neural mechanisms might inspire new advancements for HPC. Those insights into the brain provide simulation, and give computer scientists the opportunity to develop a new generation of computers and software that are inspired by the functional principles of the brain. HPC opens up new avenues for neuroscientists to develop virtual brain models, such as the BigBrain model, which connects the macroscopic with the microscopic organization level for the first time in a reference system. In such models, data from the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels up to cognitive systems could be combined together for a subsequent analysis at different scales.", "title": "The HBP-atlas \u2014 concept, perspectives, and application for language and speech research"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2015/scherer15_interspeech.html", "abstract": "Many species of animals use vocal communication in mating rituals, warning conspecifics, conveying location of food sources, and social learning. Not surprisingly, the human species has perfected this system of communication by developing first spoken and then written language. I will argue that the expression of emotion has been an important motor for this evolutionary advancement. In many species we find multimodal \u201caffect bursts\u201d which communicate reactions to environmental events and behavioral intentions to conspecifics through synchronized vocal, facial and bodily expression. It becomes increasingly plausible that both speech and music evolved from such affect bursts. In this talk, I will highlight the major strengths of vocal communication, especially voice quality, as compared to facial expression. While the face is a relatively discrete signaling system for specific reactions and messages, in large part restricted to human communication, the voice is a phylogenetically old and continuous carrier of information about the vocalizer's physique, enduring dispositions, strategic intention and current emotional state. The dynamic nature of voice delivery, including changes in voice quality, rhythm, intonation, and timing, is a major asset in communicating the unfolding of emotional reactions continuously in real time, allowing for instantaneous adaptation. In addition to theoretical considerations, including the suggestion of a path model for vocal communication, I will present recent empirical research from our laboratory, for both the speaking and the singing voice.

In conventional feature extraction pipelines this is done manually by means of a filter bank that is shared between the neighboring analysis windows.   Following this idea, we show that the performance gap between DNNs trained on spliced hand-crafted features and DNNs trained on raw time signal can be strongly reduced by introducing 1D-convolutional layers. Thus, the DNN is forced to learn a short-time filter bank shared over a longer time span.

The results show that, phonologically, rhetorical questions end in low boundary tones more often, but the difference is minimal (5%), especially compared to the effect of interrogative type on boundary tones (polar questions are rising and wh-questions are falling in more than 90% of the cases, respectively). Phonetically, rhetorical questions are characterized by longer utterance durations and lower initial pitch. Furthermore, the first constituent (wh-word or verb) is produced with a softer voice compared to information-seeking questions. Overall the results show that there are prosodic differences between RQs and ISQs for both polar and wh-questions. There seems to be a tendency for rhetoricity to be signalled early-on in the utterance in both polar and wh-questions. Furthermore, the phonetic cues for disambiguation are stronger in wh-questions than in polar questions.", "title": "The prosodic marking of rhetorical questions in German"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2015/zorila15_interspeech.html", "abstract": "This paper presents a fast and effective algorithm for enhancing speech intelligibility in additive noise conditions under the constraint of equal signal power before and after enhancement.

In the standard setting, two kinds of training corpora are used: a very large unlabeled corpus for learning the word embedding representations; and an in-domain training corpus with gold labels for training classifiers on the target NLP task. Because of the amount of data required to learn embeddings, they are trained on large corpus of written text. This can be an issue when dealing with non-canonical language, such as spontaneous speech: embeddings have to be adapted to fit the particularities of spoken transcriptions.

Cross-lingual speech synthesis based on voice conversion or HMM-based speech synthesis, which synthesizes foreign language speech of a specific non-native speaker reflecting the speaker-dependent acoustic characteristics extracted from the speaker's natural speech in his/her mother tongue, tends to cause a degradation of speaker individuality in synthetic speech compared to intra-lingual speech synthesis. This paper proposes a new approach to cross-lingual speech synthesis that preserves speaker individuality by explicitly using non-native speech spoken by the target speaker. Although the use of non-native speech makes it possible to preserve the speaker individuality in the synthesized target speech, naturalness is significantly degraded as the speech is directly affected by unnatural prosody and pronunciation often caused by differences in the linguistic systems of the source and target languages. To improve naturalness while preserving speaker individuality, we propose (1) a prosodic correction method based on model adaptation, and (2) a phonetic correction method based on spectrum replacement for unvoiced consonants. The experimental results demonstrate that these proposed methods are capable of significantly improving naturalness while preserving the speaker individuality in synthetic speech.", "title": "Non-native speech synthesis preserving speaker individuality based on partial correction of prosodic and phonetic characteristics"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2015/toman15_interspeech.html", "abstract": "We present an evaluation of the perception of foreign-accented natural and synthetic speech in comparison to accent-reduced synthetic speech.

To further investigate our findings by relying more strongly on the acoustic recordings, automatic speech recognition tools may become of great help, in particular to test various linguistic and ethnolinguistic hypotheses. Unfortunately, Yucatec Maya, with less than one million native speakers, is an under-resourced language with respect to digital resources. As a total, 24 minutes of ritual speech from three performances were manually transcribed by expert linguists in Yucatec and a basic pronunciation dictionary for Yucatec was created accordingly. The transcribed acoustic recordings were then automatically time-aligned on a phonetic and lexical basis. Automatic segmentations were used to measure tempo changes, durations of breath units as well as to examine their link with the structure of the ritual text.", "title": "Analysing rhythm in ritual discourse in yucatec maya using automatic speech alignment"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2015/hasan15_interspeech.html", "abstract": "Sentence end detection (SED) is an important task for many applications and has been studied on written text and automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. In previous work it was shown that conditional random fields models gave best SED performance on a range of tasks, with and without the inclusion of prosodic features. So far, true transcripts were used for both training and evaluation of SED models. However, in the context of noisy ASR transcripts the performance degrades significantly, especially at medium to high ASR error rates. In this work we demonstrate the correlation of SED performance with word error rate (WER), at different ASR system performance levels. A new method is introduced for transferring SED labels onto noisy ASR transcripts for model training of noise-matched SED models. The proposed method significantly improves the performance of SED models, and provides 11% relative gain in slot error rate when compared with models trained on true transcripts. This paper further investigates the effect of noise-matched trained SED with different features. It is observed that the impact of textual features reduces significantly with low ASR performance.

One possible solution to have both surface contours and landmarks of the articulators is to combine different imaging techniques.

To study these two phenomena, we used longitudinal radiographic data of sixty-eight typical subjects (966 radiographs, taken from 1 month to 25 years) and twelve fetuses (anatomical sections). In this study, we analyzed the growth curves and growth types of the hard and soft palate, the pharyngeal cavity and the estimated length of the whole vocal tract using non-linear mixed-effect models, in order to take advantage of our unique longitudinal dataset. Results indicate that most of the structures follow a neural/somatic growth type, while the pharyngeal cavity follows a more somatic growth type. As concerns sexual dimorphism, no prepubertal differences were found, suggesting that the sexual dimorphism is likely to begin at puberty.

There is no cure for Parkinson's disease. Speech and motor function declines as the disease progresses. Automatic assessment of the disease condition may advance the treatment of Parkinson's disease with objective, inexpensive measures. Speech acoustics, which can be easily obtained from patients, has been used for automatic assessment. The use of information in motor function of articulator (e.g., jaw, tongue, or lips) has rarely been investigated. In this paper, we proposed an approach of automatic assessment of Parkinson's condition using both acoustic data and acoustically-inverted articulatory data. The quasi-articulatory features were obtained from the Parkinson's acoustic speech data using acoustic-to-articulatory inverse mapping. Support vector regression (SVR) and deep neural network (DNN) regression were used in the experiment. Results indicated adding articulatory data to acoustic data can improve the performance of using acoustic data only, for both SVR and DNN. In addition, deep neural network outperformed support vector regression on the same data features measured with Pearson correlation but not with Spearman correlation.

Most of present approaches to addressing the ROS variation focus on the change of speech signals in dynamic properties caused by ROS, and accordingly modify the dynamic model, e.g., the transition probabilities of the hidden Markov model (HMM). However, an abnormal ROS changes not only the dynamic but also the static property of speech signals, and thus can not be compensated for purely by modifying the dynamic model.   This paper proposes an ROS learning approach based on deep neural networks (DNN), which involves an ROS feature as the input of the DNN model and so the spectrum distortion caused by ROS can be learned and compensated for. The experimental results show that this approach can deliver better performance for too slow and too fast utterances, demonstrating our conjecture that ROS impacts both the dynamic and the static property of speech.

We demonstrate this for arbitration application, where we obtain 31% relative reduction in arbitration metric. We additionally demonstrate a novel application of confidence-scores in deep-neural-network (DNN) adaptation, where we strongly improve the relative reduction in word-error-rate (WER) for speaker adaptation on limited data.", "title": "Confidence-features and confidence-scores for ASR applications in arbitration and DNN speaker adaptation"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2015/liu15c_interspeech.html", "abstract": "This work presents our attempt to understand the research topics that characterize the papers submitted to a conference, by using topic modeling and data visualization techniques.

The conventional approach to contaminated speech recognition in real environments uniquely extracts the clean isolated signals of individual sources ( e.g., by noise reduction, dereverberation, and source separation). One of the main limitations of this cascading approach is that the accuracy of speech recognition is upper bounded by the accuracy of preprocessing. To overcome this limitation, our method marginalizes out uncertain isolated speech signals by integrating source separation and speech recognition in a Bayesian manner. A sufficient number of samples are drawn from the posterior distribution of isolated speech signals by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, and then the posterior distributions of uttered texts for those samples are integrated. Under a certain condition, this Monte Carlo integration is shown to reduce to the well-known method called ROVER that integrates recognized texts obtained from sampled speech signals. Results of simultaneous speech recognition experiments showed that in terms of word accuracy the proposed method significantly outperformed conventional cascading methods.", "title": "Bayesian integration of sound source separation and speech recognition: a new approach to simultaneous speech recognition"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2015/himawan15_interspeech.html", "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition from multiple distant microphones poses significant challenges because of noise and reverberations.

To this end, several advances in speech enhancement, acoustic scene analysis as well as acoustic modeling, have recently contributed to improve the state-of-the-art in the field. One of the most effective approaches to derive a robust acoustic modeling is based on using contaminated speech, which proved helpful in reducing the acoustic mismatch between training and testing conditions.

The experimental results, obtained using both real and simulated data, show a significant advantage in using these three methods, overall providing a 15% error rate reduction compared to the baseline systems.

This new modified-prior PLDA model incorporates the covariance matrix scaled with duration of each utterance for each speaker, which achieves more discriminative characteristics by learning the duration variability as well as session variation in the i-vector space. Furthermore, an efficient Quality Measure Function (QMF) method which adopts duration variation as a compensation technique is employed to eliminate the linear shift in the score domain. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach, experiments were conducted on the NIST SRE10 core-core task in condition-5 with varying test utterance duration, in which the i-vectors of test utterances were extracted from full segment and randomly truncated segments of duration 10s and 20s.

The experimental results showed that a reliable and high-performance dialog act model was built only with a small volume of labeled data and domain knowledge.", "title": "Dialog act modeling for virtual personal assistant applications using a small volume of labeled data and domain knowledge"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2015/zainko15_interspeech.html", "abstract": "Announcements at railway stations are a major information source for passengers.

The MRS framework trains a stack of classifier ensembles, where each classifier in an ensemble concatenates the raw acoustic feature and the outputs of its bottom ensemble as a new feature, and different classifiers in an ensemble work with different window lengths. The bDNN classifier first generates multiple base predictions for a frame from a given window that is centered on the frame and contains multiple neighboring frames, and then aggregates the base predictions for the final prediction.

Many if not all of the LM probabilities need to be updated, the model needs to be renormalized and the ASR system needs to load a new, updated LM for each sentence. In computer-aided translation environments the time loss induced by these complex operations seriously reduces the potential of ASR as an efficient input method.   In this paper we present a novel LM adaptation technique that drastically reduces the complexity of each of these operations. The technique consists of LM probability updates using exponential weights based on TM probabilities for each sentence and does not enforce probability renormalization. Instead of storing each resulting language model in its entirety, we only store the update weights which also reduces disk storage and loading time during ASR. Experiments on Dutch read speech translated from English show that both disk storage and recognition time drop dramatically compared to a baseline system that employs a more conventional way of updating the LM.", "title": "Efficient language model adaptation for automatic speech recognition of spoken translations"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2015/mieno15_interspeech.html", "abstract": "Simultaneous speech translation is a technology that attempts to reduce the delay inherent in speech translation by beginning translation before the end of explicit sentence boundaries.

In this paper, we make the first steps towards evaluation of simultaneous speech translation systems in consideration of both speed and accuracy. We collect user evaluations of speech translation results with different levels of accuracy and delay, and using this data to learn the parameters of an evaluation measure that can judge the trade-off between these two factors.

The impaired movement of muscles for speech production leads to disordered speech where utterances have prolonged pause intervals, slow speaking rates, poor articulation of phonemes, syllable deletions, etc. These present challenges towards the use of speech technologies for automatic processing of dysarthric speech data. In order to address these challenges, this work begins by addressing the performance degradation faced in forced alignment. We perform initial alignments to locate long pauses in dysarthric speech and make use of the pause intervals as anchor points. We apply speech recognition for word lattice outputs for recovering the time-stamps of the words in disordered or incomplete pronunciations. By verifying the initial alignments with word lattices, we obtain the reliably aligned segments. These segments provide constraints for new alignment grammars, that can improve alignment and transcription quality. We have applied the proposed strategy to the TORGO corpus and obtained improved alignments for most dysarthric speech data, while maintaining good alignments for non-dysarthric speech data.", "title": "Improving automatic forced alignment for dysarthric speech transcription"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2015/wodarczak15_interspeech.html", "abstract": "This study investigates timing of communicative behaviour with respect to speaker's respiratory cycle.

Recently, a parametrized form of ReLU (PReLU) was shown to give superior performance compared to ReLU on large scale computer vision tasks. PReLU is a generalized version of LReLU where the gradient is learned adaptively from the training data. In this paper we investigate PReLU based deep convolutional neural networks for noise robust speech recognition. We report experimental results on Aurora-4 multi-condition training task. We show that PReLU gives slightly better Word Error Rates (WERs) on noisy test sets compared to ReLU.

The presence of speaker specific information and the homogeneity of this information between the two signals of a given voice comparison trial should be evaluated.

The proposed system employs sustained vowels of the Saarbr\u00fccken database from which two age groups are examined: adults and elders. Mel frequency cepstral coefficients for characterization, and Gaussian mixture models for classification are utilized. In addition, fusion of vowels at score level is considered to improve detection performance. Results suggest that age might be effectively recognized using normal and pathological voices when using sustained vowels as acoustical material, opening up possibilities for the design of automatic age-dependent voice pathology detection systems.", "title": "Automatic age detection in normal and pathological voice"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Keynotes"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Feature Extraction and Modeling with Neural Networks"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Prosody 1-3"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Speech Intelligibility Enhancement"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Detecting and Predicting Mental and Social Disorders"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Spoken Language Understanding 1-3"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Active Perception in Human and Machine Speech Communication (Special Session)"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Speaker Recognition and Diarization 1-3"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Speech Synthesis 1-3"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Mining and Annotation of Spoken and Multimodal Resources"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Speech Production Data and Models"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Deep Neural Networks in Language and Accent Recognition"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Speech Transmission"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Language Modeling for Conversational Speech"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Interspeech 2015 Computational Paralinguistics ChallengE (ComParE): Degree of Nativeness, Parkinson's & Eating Condition (Special Session)"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Pronunciation, Prosody and Audiovisual Features and Models"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Speech Analysis and Representation 1-3"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Speech Recognition \u2014 Technologies and Systems for New Applications"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Show and Tell Session 1-4 (Special Session)"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Distant and Reverberant Speech Recognition"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "L2 Speech Perception and Production"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Information and Metadata Extraction from Speech"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Deep Neural Networks for Speech Synthesis"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Speaker and Language Recognition"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Neural Networks and Speaker Adaptation"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Brain- and Other Biosignal-based Spoken Communication"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Deep Neural Networks in Speaker Recognition"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Speech Science in End-user Applications (Special Session)"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Speech Recognition: Evaluation and Low-resource Languages"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Emotion 1, 2"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Language Modeling for Speech Recognition"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Fast Efficient and Scalable Computing for Neural Nets"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Source Separation and Computational Auditory Scene Analysis"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Computational Models of Human Speech Perception"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Prosody Modeling for Speech Synthesis"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Speech and Language Processing of Children's Speech (Special Session)"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Syllables and Segments 1, 2"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Speech Enhancement"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Phonetic Recognition: Novel Approaches and Understanding"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Varieties of Speech"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Conversational Interaction"}, {"url": null, "abstract": null, "title": "Speech and Audio Segmentation and Classification;
