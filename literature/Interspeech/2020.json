They have extremely large lexical inventories, and the elements in these inventories can be combined to generate a potentially unbounded set of distinct messages. Regularities at many different levels of representation \u2014 from the phonetic level through the syntax and semantics \u2014 support people's ability to process mappings between the physical reality of speech, and the objects, events, and relationships that speech refers to. However, human languages also simplify reality. The phonological system establishes equivalence classes amongst articulatory-acoustic events that have considerable variation at the parametric level. The semantic system similarly establishes equivalence classes amongst real-world phenomena having considerable variation. The tension between simplicity and complexity is a recurring theme of research on language modelling. In this talk, I will present three case studies in which a pioneering simple model omitted important complexities that were either included in later models, or that remain as challenges to this day.  The first is the acoustic theory of speech production, as developed by Gunnar Fant, the inaugural Medal recipient in 1989. By approximating the vocal tract as a half-open tube, it showed that the first three formants of vowels (which are the most important for the perception of vowel quality) can be computed as a linear systems problem. The second is the autosegmental-metrical theory of intonation, to which I contributed early in my career. It made the simplifying assumption that the correct model of phonological representation will support the limited set of observed non-local patterns, while excluding non-local patterns that do not naturally occur. The third case concerns how word-formation patterns are generalised in forming new words, whether though inflectional morphology (as in \u201cone wug; two wugs\u201d) or derivational morphology (as in \u201cnickname, unnicknameable\u201d). Several early models of word-formation assume that the morphemes are conceptual categories, sharing formal properties of other categories in the cognitive system. For all three case studies, I will suggest that \u2014 contrary to what one might imagine \u2014 the simple models enjoyed good success precisely because they were cognitively realistic. The most successful early models effectively incorporated ways in which the cognitive system simplifies reality. These simplifications are key to the learnability and adaptability of human languages.  The simplified core of the system provides the scaffolding for more complex or irregular aspects of language. In progressing from simple models to fully complex models, we should make sure we continue to profit from insights into how humans learn, encode, remember, and produce speech patterns.", "title": "The cognitive status of simple and complex models"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2020/li20_interspeech.html", "abstract": "Recently, there has been a strong push to transition from hybrid models\nto end-to-end (E2E) models for automatic speech recognition.

Speech-based depression screening technologies\nhave shown promising results, but primarily in systems that are trained\nusing laboratory-based recorded speech. They do not generalize well\non data from more naturalistic settings. This paper addresses the generalizability\nissue by proposing multiple adaptation strategies that update pre-trained\nmodels based on a dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) framework,\nwhich improve depression detection performance in both clean and naturalistic\nenvironments. Experimental results on two depression corpora show that\nfeature representations in CNN layers need to be adapted to accommodate\nenvironmental changes, and that increases in data quantity and quality\nare helpful for pre-training models for adaptation. The cross-corpus\nadapted systems produce relative improvements of 29.4% and 17.2% in\nunweighted average recall over non-adapted systems for both clean and\nnaturalistic corpora, respectively.", "title": "Domain Adaptation for Enhancing Speech-Based Depression Detection in Natural Environmental Conditions Using Dilated CNNs"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2020/gosztolya20b_interspeech.html", "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous chronic and severe mental disorder.\nThere are several different theories for the development of schizophrenia\nfrom an etiological point of view: neurochemical, neuroanatomical,\npsychological and genetic factors may also be present in the background\nof the disease.

Exploiting\nthe efficient segmentation capability of the U-net architecture, the\ndirect-path information can be effectively retrieved from a dedicated\nmulti-task neural network. Moreover, the training and inference of\nthe neural network only need the input of a single microphone, circumventing\nthe problem of array-structure dependence faced by common end-to-end\ndeep learning based methods. Simulations demonstrate that significantly\nhigher estimation accuracy can be achieved in high reverberant and\nlow signal-to-noise ratio environments.", "title": "U-Net Based Direct-Path Dominance Test for Robust Direction-of-Arrival Estimation"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2020/xue20b_interspeech.html", "abstract": "The performance of sound event localization and detection (SELD) degrades\nin source-overlapping cases since features of different sources collapse\nwith each other, and the network tends to fail to learn to separate\nthese features effectively. In this paper, by leveraging the conventional\nmicrophone array signal processing to generate comprehensive representations\nfor SELD, we propose a new SELD method based on multiple direction\nof arrival (DOA) beamforming and multi-task learning. By using multiple\nbeamformers to extract the signals from different DOAs, the sound field\nis more diversely described, and specialised representations of target\nsource and noises can be obtained. With labelled training data, the\nsteering vector is estimated based on the cross-power spectra (CPS)\nand the signal presence probability (SPP), which eliminates the need\nof knowing the array geometry. We design two networks for sound event\nlocalization (SED) and sound source localization (SSL) and use a multi-task\nlearning scheme for SED, in which the SSL-related task act as a regularization.\nExperimental results using the database of DCASE2019 SELD task show\nthat the proposed method achieves the state-of-art performance.", "title": "Sound Event Localization and Detection
