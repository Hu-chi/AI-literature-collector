This paper investigated the effectiveness\nof integrating articulatory movement data to deep learning-based TTS.\nThe integration of articulatory information was achieved in two ways:\n(1) direct integration, where articulatory and acoustic features were\nthe output of a deep neural network (DNN), and (2) direct integration\nplus forward-mapping, where the output articulatory features were mapped\nto acoustic features by an additional DNN; These forward-mapped acoustic\nfeatures were then combined with the output acoustic features to produce\nthe final acoustic features. Articulatory (tongue and lip) and acoustic\ndata collected from male and female speakers were used in the experiment.\nBoth objective measures and subjective judgment by human listeners\nshowed the approaches integrated articulatory information outperformed\nthe baseline approach (without using articulatory information) in terms\nof naturalness and speaker voice identity (voice similarity).", "title": "Integrating Articulatory Information in Deep Learning-Based Text-to-Speech Synthesis"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2017/ma17b_interspeech.html", "abstract": "Language Models (LMs) for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) are typically\ntrained on large text corpora from news articles, books and web documents.\nThese types of corpora, however, are unlikely to match the test distribution\nof ASR systems, which expect spoken utterances.

In WPE, the accuracy of the inverse filter estimation,\nand thus the dereverberation performance, is largely dependent on the\nestimation of the power spectral density (PSD) of the target signal.\nTherefore, the conventional WPE iteratively performs the inverse filter\nestimation, actual dereverberation and the PSD estimation to gradually\nimprove the PSD estimate. However, while such iterative procedure works\nwell when sufficiently long acoustically-stationary observed signals\nare available, WPE\u2019s performance degrades when the duration of\nobserved/accessible data is short, which typically is the case for\nreal-time applications using online block-batch processing with small\nbatches. To solve this problem, we incorporate the DNN-based spectrum\nestimator into the framework of WPE, because a DNN can estimate the\nPSD robustly even from very short observed data.

It has been found that RNNLMs perform best when trained\non a large corpus of generic text and then fine-tuned on text corresponding\nto the sub-domain for which it is to be applied. However, in many cases\nthe auxiliary features are available for the sub-domain text but not\nfor the generic text. In such cases, semi-supervised techniques can\nbe used to infer such features for the generic text data such that\nthe RNNLM can be trained and then fine-tuned on the available in-domain\ndata with corresponding auxiliary features.\n  In this paper, several\nnovel approaches are investigated for dealing with the semi-supervised\nadaptation of RNNLMs with auxiliary features as input. These approaches\ninclude: using zero features during training to mask the weights of\nthe feature sub-network; adding the feature sub-network only at the\ntime of fine-tuning; deriving the features using a parametric model\nand; back-propagating to infer the features on the generic text.

Nevertheless, the\nLR accepts some practical limitations due both to intrinsic aspects\nof its estimation process and the information used during the FVC process.\nThese aspects are embedded in a more general one, the lack of knowledge\non FVC reliability. The question of reliability remains a major challenge,\nparticularly for FVC systems where numerous variation factors like\nduration, noise, linguistic content or\u2026 within-speaker variability\nare not taken into account. Recently, we proposed an information theory-based\ncriterion able to estimate one of these factors, the homogeneity of\ninformation between the two sides of a FVC trial. Thanks to this new\ncriterion, we wish to explore new aspects of homogeneity in this article.\nWe wish to question the impact of homogeneity on reliability separately\non target and non-target trials. The study is performed using FABIOLE,\na publicly available database dedicated to this kind of studies with\na large number of recordings per target speaker. Our experiments report\nlarge differences of homogeneity impact between FVC genuine and impostor\ntrials. These results show clearly the importance of intra-speaker\nvariability effects in FVC reliability estimation.

Several previous authors\nhave shown that prediction is possible, but experiments are typically\nconfined to rigidly produced dialogue. Natural, expressive, emotive\nand prosodic speech exhibit motion patterns that are far more difficult\nto predict with considerable variation in expected head pose.\n  Recently, Long Short\nTerm Memory (LSTM) networks have become an important tool for modelling\nspeech and natural language tasks. We employ Deep Bi-Directional LSTMs\n(BLSTM) capable of learning long-term structure in language, to model\nthe relationship that speech has with rigid head motion. We then extend\nour model by conditioning with prior motion. Finally, we introduce\na generative head motion model, conditioned on audio features using\na Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE).
