In this paper we present an analysis of the generalisation\ncapability of deep learning models using cross-corpus training with\nsix different speech emotion corpora. We evaluate the models on an\nunseen corpus and analyse the learned representations using the t-SNE\nalgorithm, showing that architectures based on recurrent neural networks\nare prone to overfit the corpora present in the training set, while\narchitectures based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show better\ngeneralisation capabilities.

Most use Long Short-Term\nMemory - Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) or Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNN) to model the sequential behavior of speech. In this\npaper we propose a novel network for source separation using an encoder-decoder\nCNN and LSTM in parallel. Hyper parameters have to be chosen for both\nparts of the network and they are potentially mutually dependent. Since\nhyper parameter grid search has a high computational burden, random\nsearch is often preferred. However, when sampling a new point in the\nhyper parameter space, it can potentially be very close to a previously\nevaluated point and thus give little additional information. Furthermore,\nrandom sampling is as likely to sample in a promising area as in an\nhyper space area dominated with poor performing models. Therefore,\nwe use a Bayesian hyper parameter optimization technique and find that\nthe parallel CNN-LSTM outperforms the LSTM-only and CNN-only model.", "title": "CNN-LSTM Models for Multi-Speaker Source Separation Using Bayesian Hyper Parameter Optimization"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2019/bear19_interspeech.html", "abstract": "Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) and Sound Event Detection (SED)\nare two separate tasks in the field of computational sound scene analysis.\nIn this work, we present a new dataset with both sound scene and sound\nevent labels and use this to demonstrate a novel method for jointly\nclassifying sound scenes and recognizing sound events.

DC is usually formulated as two-step processes: embedding\nlearning and embedding clustering, which results in complex separation\npipelines and a huge obstacle in directly optimizing the actual separation\nobjectives. As for uPIT, it only minimizes the chosen permutation with\nthe lowest mean square error, doesn\u2019t discriminate it with other\npermutations. In this paper, we propose a discriminative learning method\nfor speaker-independent speech separation using deep embedding features.\nFirstly, a DC network is trained to extract deep embedding features,\nwhich contain each source\u2019s information and have an advantage\nin discriminating each target speakers. Then these features are used\nas the input for uPIT to directly separate the different sources. Finally,\nuPIT and DC are jointly trained, which directly optimizes the actual\nseparation objectives. Moreover, in order to maximize the distance\nof each permutation, the discriminative learning is applied to fine\ntuning the whole model. Our experiments are conducted on WSJ0-2mix\ndataset.

The second step is the main obstacle in training\nneural networks for speech separation. Recently proposed  Permutation\nInvariant Training (PIT) addresses this problem by determining the\noutput-label assignment which minimizes the separation error. In this\nstudy, we show that a major drawback of this technique is the overconfident\nchoice of the output-label assignment, especially in the initial steps\nof training when the network generates unreliable outputs. To solve\nthis problem, we propose  Probabilistic PIT (Prob-PIT) which considers\nthe output-label permutation as a discrete latent random variable with\na uniform prior distribution. Prob-PIT defines a log-likelihood function\nbased on the prior distributions and the separation errors of all permutations;\nit trains the speech separation networks by maximizing the log-likelihood\nfunction. Prob-PIT can be easily implemented by replacing the minimum\nfunction of PIT with a soft-minimum function. We evaluate our approach\nfor speech separation on both TIMIT and CHiME datasets.
