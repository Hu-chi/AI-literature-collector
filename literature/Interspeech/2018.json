A new undersea transatlantic telegraph cable had been laid. The idea of transmitting speech over the new telegraph cable caught the fancy of Homer Dudley, a young engineer who had just joined Bell Telephone Laboratories. This led to the invention of Vocoder - its close relative Voder was showcased as the first machine to create human speech at the 1939 New York World's Fair. However, the voice quality of vocoders was not good enough for use in commercial telephony. During the time speech scientists were busy with vocoders, several major developments took place outside speech research. Norbert Wiener developed a mathematical theory for calculating the best filters and predictors for detecting signals hidden in noise. Linear Prediction or Linear Predictive Coding became a major tool for speech processing. Claude Shannon established that the highest bit rate in a communication channel in presence of noise is achieved when the transmitted signal resembles random white Gaussian noise. Shannon\u2019s theory led to the invention of Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CELP). Nearly all digital cellular standards as well as standards for digital voice communication over the Internet use CELP coders. The success in speech coding came with understanding of what we hear and what we do not. Speech encoding at low bit rates introduce errors and these errors must be hidden under the speech signal to become inaudible. More and more, speech technologies are being used in different acoustic environments raising questions about the robustness of the technology. Human listeners handle situations well when the signal at our ears is not just one signal, but also a superposition of many acoustic signals. We need new research to develop signal-processing methods that can separate the mixed acoustic signal into individual components and provide performance similar or superior to that of human listeners.", "title": "From Vocoders to Code-Excited Linear Prediction: Learning How We Hear What We Hear"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2018/karita18_interspeech.html", "abstract": "We propose a novel semi-supervised method for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). It can exploit large unpaired speech and text datasets, which require much less human effort to create paired speech-to-text datasets. Our semi-supervised method targets the extraction of an intermediate representation between speech and text data using a shared encoder network. Autoencoding of text data with this shared encoder improves the feature extraction of text data as well as that of speech data when the intermediate representations of speech and text are similar to each other as an inter-domain feature. In other words, by combining speech-to-text and text-to-text mappings through the shared network, we can improve speech-to-text mapping by learning to reconstruct the unpaired text data in a semi-supervised end-to-end manner. We investigate how to design suitable inter-domain loss, which minimizes the dissimilarity between the encoded speech and text sequences, which originally belong to quite different domains.

The main idea is to first use the SR-HPM to explore the prosodic structures of utterances and extract the prosodic units. Then, local speaking rate is estimated for each prosodic unit (prosodic phrase in this study). Some major influence factors including tone, base syllable type, prosodic structure and speaking rate of the higher prosodic units (utterance and BG/PG) are compensated in the local SR estimation.

Based on the results of the four experiments we were able to establish to what degree the attitudinal frames of reference of the two groups overlap and how they differ. Verbal labels were assessed regarding their emotional content in terms of valence, activation and dominance and for the linguistic opposition between assertive and interrogative speech act and hence permit to abstract from the language of the rater and ultimately even abstract from the attitudinal categories used when eliciting the stimuli. Instead we regard each utterance as a data-point in the emotional space. We found that the judgments of the two rater groups agree well with respect to the valence of attitudinal expressions and diverge most as to the perceived activation of the stimulus presenter. Cantonese speaking participants seem to mirror Germans\u2019 ratings of German stimuli better than vice versa, which suggests an interesting asymmetry of attitudinal perception.

For the extraction of the spectral envelope of speech, which conveys the formant frequencies produced by the resonances of the slowly varying vocal tract, an often used frame length is within 20-30 ms. However, this kind of conventional frame-based spectral analysis is oblivious of the broader temporal context of the signal and is prone to degradation by, for example, environmental noise. In this paper, we propose a new frame-based linear prediction (LP) analysis method that includes a regularization term that penalizes energy differences in consecutive frames of an all-pole spectral envelope model. This integrates the slowly varying nature of the vocal tract as a part of the analysis. Objective evaluations related to feature distortion and phonetic representational capability were performed by studying the properties of the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) representations computed from different spectral estimation methods under noisy conditions using the TIMIT database.

The key idea behind SWM is to obtain optimal weights to combine HRTFs from the training subjects based on the relationship of anthropometric features between the target subject and the training subjects. To this end, SWM learns two sparse representations between the target subject and the training subjects in terms of anthropometric features and HRTFs, respectively. A non-negative sparse model is used for this purpose when considering the non-negative property of the anthropometric features.

Meanwhile, WB data have been more scarce not being enough to train factor analysis and PLDA models. Thus, the usual practice when dealing with WB speech consists in downsampling the signal to 8 kHz, which implies potential loss of useful information. Instead, we experimented upsampling the training telephone data and leaving the WB data unchanged. We adopt two techniques to upsample telephone data: (1) using a feed-forward neural network, termed Bandwidth Extension (BWE) network, to predict WB features given NB features as input; and (2) using basic upsampling with a low-pass filter interpolator. While the former intends to estimate the high frequency information, the latter does not. The upsampled features are used to train state-of-the art i-vector and recently proposed x-vector models.

Since speech is a non-stationary signal, the magnitude and frequency vary over the time. Consequently, NLM is not that effective in removing the noise components from the speech signal as observed in the case of image enhancement. To address this issue, the noisy speech signal is first decomposed into variational mode functions (VMFs) using VMD.

Results indicated differences in tongue shape between singletons and geminates, especially for ejectives and implosives. Singleton ejectives displayed raised tongue bodies not found in geminate ejectives. Singleton implosives resembled voiceless stops, but geminate implosives were variably produced with tongue body raising. I suggest that the results can be attributed to fortition in geminates. Tongue body raising in singleton ejectives may be an enhancement strategy to the ejective contrast that is not necessary in longer geminates.

A method based on weighted finite state transducers is proposed, to model specific prompt corrections, such as repetitions, substitutions and deletions, as observed in real recordings. Iterative cycles of lightly-supervised training are performed in which decoding improves the transcriptions and the derived models. Improvements are due to increasing accuracy in phone-to-sound alignment and in the training data selection. The effectiveness of the proposed methods for relabelling and acoustic modelling is assessed through experiemnts on the CHOREC corpus, in terms of sequence error rate and alignment accuracy.

To handle this deficiency, in this paper, we used the novel approach of tackling pronunciation verification as an anomaly detection problem. We achieved this by modeling only the correct pronunciation of each individual phoneme with a one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained using a set of speech attributes features, namely the manner and place of articulation. These features are extracted from a bank of pre-trained Deep Neural Network (DNN) speech attributes classifiers. The one-class SVM model classifies each phoneme production as normal (correct) or an anomaly (incorrect).

The noisy spectrogram is multiplied by this predicted mask to obtain the enhanced magnitude spectrogram and it is transformed back into the time domain by using the unaltered noisy speech phase.

The results suggest that AR performs well for same speaker comparisons. However, for different speaker comparisons, the system is performing just worse than chance.

Covarying secondary attributes are conveyed which may serve to enhance the primary correlate by contributing additional properties increasing the distance between the two lexical categories.

Speech is assumed to be stationary over a short-term window and a Hanning window is typically applied in the calculation of ACF. As a result of windowing, the ACF tapers as the autocorrelation lags increase. Boersma demonstrated that the tapering effect could be compensated for by dividing the ACF of the windowed signal by the autocorrelation of the windowing function itself, referred to as wACF hereafter. We recently found that wACF could cause overcompensation and therefore, result in errors in pitch detection.

However, for natural vowels, formant data shift considerably away from the resonant frequencies of a uniform tube. The proposed method is motivated from these observations: (a) the frequency of a spectral valley, F_v, depends inversely on VTL; (b) there is much smaller shift in F_v, across vowels, from the corresponding valley frequency of a uniform tube; (c) F_v can be estimated from the spectral envelope itself. VTL has been estimated for the Peterson and Barney (33 male and 28 female speakers) and the TIMIT (326 male and 136 female speakers) databases.

Hence, these dictionaries can simultaneously model the extremal and average behaviour of the data. The convex representations obtained from these deeper dictionaries are referred as deep convex representations. Due to inherent sparsity, they result in efficient classification performance.

We apply the proposed method to a LAS E2E model and show its effectiveness in experiments on a voice search task with both artificial and real contextual information.

The model used in this work includes the direct impact of the acoustic pressure on the transversal plane of the vocal folds and an acoustic perturbation component to the glottal flow. Simulations indicate that both of these mechanisms, when applied separately, cause similar perturbations in phonation parameters when f_o crosses f_{R1}. Enabling both mechanisms simultaneously tends to make the separately emerging features more prominent.

For this we use articulatory movement data collected from five subjects using an Electromagnetic articulograph at neutral, fast and slow speaking rates. As candidate transformation functions (TF), we use affine transformations with a diagonal matrix and a full matrix and a nonlinear function modeled by a deep neural network (DNN). Since the duration of an utterance in different speaking rates would typically be unequal, it is required to time align the articulatory movement trajectories, which, in turn, affects the TF learnt. Therefore, we propose an iterative algorithm to alternately optimize for the TF and the time alignments. Subject specific experiments reveal that while N2F transformation can be well described by an affine transformation with a full matrix, N2S transformation is better represented by a more complex nonlinear function modeled by a DNN.

It contains a probabilistic encoder which projects an input data to latent space and a probabilistic decoder which projects data from latent space back to input space. This allows us to learn a robust latent representation of sources corrupted with noise and other sources. The latent representation is then fed to the decoder to yield the separated source. Both encoder and decoder are implemented via multilayer perceptron (MLP). In contrast to prevalent techniques, we argue that VAE is a more principled approach to source separation. Experimentally, we find that the proposed framework yields reasonable improvements when compared to baseline methods available in the literature i.e. DNN and RNN with different masking functions and autoencoders. We show that our method performs better than best of the relevant methods with \u223c 2 dB improvement in the source to distortion ratio.", "title": "Monoaural Audio Source Separation Using Variational Autoencoders"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2018/gang18_interspeech.html", "abstract": "Many applications of single channel source separation (SCSS) including automatic speech recognition (ASR), hearing aids etc. require an estimation of only one source from a mixture of many sources.

Simulations successfully replicate expected trends in word competition and show plausible competitors as the signal unfolds, but acoustic model accuracy should be improved. Despite the number of responses per word being relatively small (never more than five), correlations between model estimates and participants' responses are moderate. Future directions in acoustic model training and simulating MALD data are discussed.", "title": "Implementing DIANA to Model Isolated Auditory Word Recognition in English"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2018/sharma18d_interspeech.html", "abstract": "Homophones, words that sound same, influence spoken word recognition. Whether the effects of homophone density (i.e., number of same-sounding words) on spoken word recognition are facilitatory or inhibitory or complex is a matter of ongoing debate. In addition, there are limited studies investigating the effects of homophone density, probably due to paucity of homophones in the examined languages (e.g., English). In comparison, languages such as Mandarin Chinese have abundant homophony that makes it a suitable tool to investigate the effects of homophone density. In the current study, an auditory naming task was conducted using Mandarin Chinese to investigate the effects of homophone density on spoken word recognition. Using mixed modeling, a significant inhibitory effect of homophone density (\u03b2 = 0.0098, t = 2.10) on reaction time was found. Participants were slower in naming words with high homophone density, possibly due to competition posed by more number of homophones, as compared to the words with low homophone density. Further, an interaction between homophone density and syllable frequency was found i.e., for high syllable frequency, homophone density effects were inhibitory but for low syllable frequency, the inhibitory effect was reduced. Taken together, the effects of homophone density are not straightforward but complex.", "title": "Effects of Homophone Density on Spoken Word Recognition in Mandarin Chinese"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2018/xie18_interspeech.html", "abstract": "The present study investigated whether duration of lip movement could improve intelligibility of lexical pitch contours under noisy condition. Eighteen Chinese speakers were asked to identify a Mandarin lexical tone in one pair of tones under auditory only (AO) and audiovisual (AV) condition. Two types of tone pairs were used in the study: maximum contrastive pair (falling vs. dipping tones, the durational difference of lip movement was 100ms) and minimum contrastive pair (rising vs. falling tones, the difference was 33ms). The results showed that duration of lip movement enhanced discrimination in the maximum pair whereas the similar lengths of rising and dipping tones attenuated such visual benefit. The finding suggested that visual timing information could be a specific cue for audiovisual lexical tone perception.", "title": "Visual Timing Information in Audiovisual Speech Perception: Evidence from Lexical Tone Contour"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2018/barnaud18_interspeech.html", "abstract": "During speech development, babies learn to perceive and produce speech units, especially syllables and phonemes. However, the mechanisms underlying the acquisition of speech units still remain unclear. We propose a Bayesian model of speech communication, named \u201cCOSMO SylPhon\u201d, for studying the acquisition of both syllables and phonemes. In this model, speech development involves a sensory learning phase mainly related to perception development and a motor learning phase mainly related to production development. We analyze how an agent can learn speech units during these two phases through an unsupervised learning process based on syllable stimuli. We show that the learning process enables to efficiently learn the distribution of syllabic stimuli provided in the environment. Importantly, we show that if agents are equipped with a bootstrap process inspired by the Frame-Content Theory of speech development, they learn to associate consonants to specific articulatory gestures, providing the basis for consonantal articulatory invariance.", "title": "COSMO SylPhon: A Bayesian Perceptuo-motor Model to Assess Phonological Learning"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2018/maggu18_interspeech.html", "abstract": "Research studies provide evidence for the facilitative effects of musical and linguistic experience on lexical pitch learning. However, the effect of interaction of linguistic and musical pitch experience on lexical pitch processing is a matter of ongoing research. In the current study, we sought to examine the effect of combination of musical and linguistic pitch experience on learning of novel lexical pitch. Using a 10-session pseudoword-picture association training paradigm, we compared the learning performance of musicians and non-musicians who either spoke a non-tone language, spoke one tone language, or spoke two tone languages. Among the non-tone language speakers, we found that musicians showed enhanced learning of novel lexical pitch as compared to non-musicians. In comparison, among the tone-language speakers, we found no significant difference in the learning performance of musicians and non-musicians no matter they spoke one or more tone languages. We conclude that though musical experience facilitates linguistic pitch learning, the effects of combination of musical and linguistic pitch experience are not additive i.e. possessing both types of pitch experience is no better than possessing either one of them and knowing two tone languages does not facilitate the learning of a new tone language beyond the knowledge of one.", "title": "Experience-dependent Influence of Music and Language on Lexical Pitch Learning Is Not Additive"}, {"url": "https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2018/dellwo18_interspeech.html", "abstract": "We tested the influence of fundamental oscillation (fo) on human and machine speaker recognition performance in vocalic test utterances. In experiment I, we trained a Gaussian-Mixture model on 15 speakers (80 multi-word utterances each) and tested it with sustained vowel utterances (/a:/, /i:/ and /u:/) under six fo conditions, three changing (fall, rise, fall-rise) and three steady-state (high, mid, low). Results revealed better performance for the steady-state compared to the changing conditions and within the steady-state condition, performance was poorest for high fo. In experiment II, we tested 9 human listeners on a subset of 4 speakers from experiment I. They went through two training tasks (training 1: multi-word utterances; training 2: words). In the test, they recognized speakers based on the same vocalic utterances as in experiment I (for these 4 speakers). Results showed that performance was about equally high for the changing and steady-state vowels, however, in the steady-state condition performance was best for high fo vowels. The experiments suggest that (a) fo has an influence on the strength of speaker specific characteristics in vowels and (b) humans - compared to machines - pay attention to different acoustic
