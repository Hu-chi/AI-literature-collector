This observation motivates us to consider a feature-centric recommendation approach to item recommendation: instead of directly predicting the rating on items, we predict the rating on the features of items, and use such ratings to derive the rating on an item. This approach offers several advantages over the traditional item-centric approach: it incorporates more information about why a user chooses an item, it generalizes better due to the denser feature rating data, it explains the prediction of item ratings through the predicted feature ratings. Another contribution is turning a principled item-centric solution into a feature-centric solution, instead of inventing a new algorithm that is feature-centric. This approach maximally leverages previous research. We demonstrate this approach by turning the traditional item-centric latent factor model into a feature-centric solution and demonstrate its superiority over item-centric approaches.", "title": "Are Features Equally Representative?

This information has strong impact on community detection since a node prefers to build links with nodes inside its community than those outside its community. In this paper, we propose a preference-based nonnegative matrix factorization (PNMF) model to incorporate implicit link preference information. Unlike conventional matrix factorization approaches, which simply approximate the original adjacency matrix in value, our model maximizes the likelihood of the preference order for each node by following the intuition that a node prefers its neighbors than other nodes.

As a case study, we conducted experiments on ranking answers for questions on Stack Overflow, a CQA system for professional and enthusiast programmers.

Two effective approaches are Content-based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering, each serving a specific recommendation scenario. The Content-based Filtering approaches inspect rich contexts of the recommended items, while the Collaborative Filtering approaches predict the interests of long-tail users by collaboratively learning from interests of related users. We have observed empirically that, for the problem of news topic displaying, both the rich context of news topics and the long-tail users exist. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Content-based Collaborative Filtering approach (CCF) to bring both Content-based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering approaches together. We found that combining the two is not an easy task, but the benefits of CCF are impressive. On one hand, CCF makes recommendations based on the rich contexts of the news. On the other hand, CCF collaboratively analyzes the scarce feedbacks from the long-tail users. We tailored this CCF approach for the news topic displaying on the Bing front page and demonstrated great gains in attracting users.

It also supposes the agents initially do not have a vocabulary for logical categories (i.e. logical connectives), nor grammatical constructions for expressing logical combinations of basic categories through language. The results of the experiments we have performed show that a language system for the expression of logical combinations emerges as a result of a process of self-organisation of the agents' linguistic interactions. Such a language system is concise, because it only uses words and grammatical constructions for three logical categories (i.e. and, or, not). It is also expressive, since it allows the communication of logical combinations of categories of the same complexity as propositional logic formulas, using linguistic devices such as syntactic categories, word order and auxiliary words.

In the AI of the future, these notions will also play a role in producing natural, socially appropriate artificially intelligent agents that encompass subtle and complex human social and affective skills. We propose here a Bayesian generalization of the sociological affect control theory of self as a theoretical foundation for socio-affectively skilled artificial agents. This theory posits that each human maintains an internal model of his or her deep sense of \"self\" that captures their emotional, psychological, and socio-cultural sense of being in the world. The \"self\" is then externalised as an identity within any given interpersonal and institutional situation, and this situational identity is the person's local (in space and time) representation of the self. Situational identities govern the actions of humans according to affect control theory. Humans will seek situations that allow them to enact identities consistent with their sense of self. This consistency is cumulative over time: if some parts of a person's self are not actualized regularly, the person will have a growing feeling of inauthenticity that they will seek to resolve. In our present generalisation, the self is represented as a probability distribution, allowing it to be multi-modal (a person can maintain multiple different identities), uncertain (a person can be unsure about who they really are), and learnable (agents can learn the identities and selves of other agents).

The problem is believed to be NP-Hard, and to the best of our knowledge there are no previously published algorithms aimed at computing optimal solutions. We show how to model the problem as a graph search, and propose a heuristic based on eigenvalues of related matrices. Applying the A* search strategy with this heuristic is guaranteed to find the optimal solution. Experimental results on common datasets show that the proposed algorithm can effectively select columns from moderate size matrices, typically improving by orders of magnitude the run time of exhaustive search. We also show how to combine the proposed algorithm with other non-optimal (but much faster) algorithms in a ``two stage'' framework, which is guaranteed to improve the accuracy of the other algorithms.", "title": "Optimal Column Subset Selection by A-Star Search"}, {"url": "https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/9354", "abstract": "Model selection and hyperparameter optimization is crucial in applying machine learning to a novel dataset.

(2) We use an error-correcting code, specifically a repetition code, to encode the inputs to this channel, in conjunction with a maximum-likelihood decoding rule. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we transcribe isolated Hindi words with the help of Mechanical Turk workers unfamiliar with Hindi. We successfully recover Hindi words with an accuracy of over 85% (and 94% in a 4-best list) using a 15-fold repetition code. We also estimate the conditional entropy of the input to this channel (Hindi words) given the channel output (transcripts from crowdsourced workers) to be less than 2 bits; this serves as a theoretical estimate of the average number of bits of auxiliary information required for errorless recovery.", "title": "Acquiring Speech Transcriptions Using Mismatched Crowdsourcing"}, {"url": "https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/9386", "abstract": "Answering conjunctive queries (CQs) over EL knowledge bases (KBs) with complex role inclusions is PSPACE-hard and in PSPACE in certain cases; however, if complex role inclusions are restricted to role transitivity, a tight upper complexity bound has so far been unknown.

In this paper, we first provide an axiomatic characterisation for epistemic states by using nine rules about beliefs and conditional beliefs, and then argue that the last two rules are too strong and should be eliminated for characterising the belief state of an agent.

Our approach probabilistically combines two prominent threads from the shape literature: skeleton-based (medial axis) representations of shape, and part-based representations of shape, in which shapes are combinations of primitive parts. Our approach  recasts  skeleton-based shape representation as a mixture estimation problem, allowing us to apply probabilistic estimation techniques to the problem of 3D shape decomposition, extending earlier work on the 2D case. The estimated 3D shape decompositions approximate human shape decomposition judgments. We present a tractable implementation  of  the framework, which begins by over-segmenting objects at concavities, and then probabilistically merges them to create a distribution over possible decompositions. This results in a hierarchy of decompositions at different structural scales, again closely matching known properties of human shape representation. The probabilistic estimation procedures that arise naturally in the model allow effective prediction of missing parts. We present results on shapes from a standard database illustrating the effectiveness of the approach.", "title": "A Bayesian Approach to Perceptual 3D Object-Part Decomposition Using Skeleton-Based Representations"}, {"url": "https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/9794", "abstract": "As the popularity of touch-screen devices, understanding a user's hand-drawn sketch has become an increasingly important research topic in artificial intelligence and computer vision. However, different from natural images, the hand-drawn sketches are often highly abstract, with sparse visual information and large intra-class variance, making the problem more challenging. In this work, we study how to build effective representations for sketch recognition. First, to capture saliency patterns of different scales and spatial arrangements, a Gabor-based low-level representation is proposed. Then, based on this representation, to discovery more complex patterns in a sketch, a Hybrid Multilayer Sparse Coding (HMSC) model is proposed to learn mid-level representations. An improved dictionary learning algorithm is also leveraged in HMSC to reduce overfitting to common but trivial patterns. Extensive experiments show that the proposed representations are highly discriminative and lead to large improvements over the state of the arts.", "title": "Building Effective Representations for Sketch Recognition"}, {"url": "https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/9795", "abstract": "Face hallucination method is proposed to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution ones for better visualization. However, conventional hallucination methods are often designed for controlled settings and cannot handle varying conditions of pose, resolution degree, and blur. In this paper, we present a new method of face hallucination, which can consistently improve the resolution of face images even with large appearance variations. Our method is based on a novel network architecture called Bi-channel Convolutional Neural Network (Bi-channel CNN). It extracts robust face representations from raw input by using deep convolutional network, then adaptively integrates two channels of information (the raw input image and face representations) to predict the high-resolution image.

This problemis exacerbated when we rely unrealistically on a singletraining data source, which is often insufficient to coverthe intrinsically complex face variations. This paperproposes a principled multi-task learning approachbased on Discriminative Gaussian Process Latent VariableModel (DGPLVM), named GaussianFace, for faceverification. In contrast to relying unrealistically on asingle training data source, our model exploits additional data from multiple source-domains to improve the generalization performance of face verification inan unknown target-domain. Importantly, our model can adapt automatically to complex data distributions, and therefore can well capture complex face variations inherent in multiple sources. To enhance discriminative power, we introduced a more efficient equivalent form of Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis to DGPLVM.To speed up the process of inference and prediction, we exploited the low rank approximation method. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model in learning from diverse data sources and generalizing to unseen domains. Specifically, the accuracy of our algorithm achieved an impressive accuracyrate of 98.52% on the well-known and challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark.

Especially, a major bottleneck for current state-of-the-art methods is the significant performance decline with increasing occlusion. A common technique for occlusion handling is to train a set of occlusion-specific detectors and merge their results directly. These detectors are trained independently and the relationship among them is ignored. In this paper, we consider pedestrian detection in different occlusion levels as different but related problems, and propose a multi-task model to jointly consider their relatedness and differences. The proposed model adopts multi-task learning algorithm to map pedestrians in different occlusion levels to a common space, where all models corresponding to different occlusion levels are constrained to share a common set of features, and a boosted detector is then constructed to distinguish pedestrians from background. The proposed approach is evaluated on the challenging Caltech pedestrian detection benchmark, and achieves state-of-the-art results on different occlusion-specific test sets.", "title": "A Boosted Multi-Task Model for Pedestrian Detection with Occlusion Handling"}, {"url": "https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/9799", "abstract": "We present an unsupervised approach for abnormal event detection in videos. We propose, given a dictionary of features learned from local spatiotemporal cuboids using the sparse coding objective, the abnormality of an event depends jointly on two factors: the frequency of each feature in reconstructing all events (or, rarity of a feature) and the strength by which it is used in reconstructing the current event (or, the absolute coefficient). The Incremental Coding Length (ICL) of a feature is a measure of its entropy gain. Given a dictionary, the ICL computation does not involve any parameter, is computationally efficient and has been used for saliency detection in images with impressive results. In this paper, the rarity of a dictionary feature is learned online as its average energy, a function of its ICL. The proposed approach is applicable to real world streaming videos. Experiments on three benchmark datasets and evaluations in comparison with a number of mainstream algorithms show that the approach is comparable to the state-of-the-art.", "title": "Online Detection of Abnormal Events Using Incremental Coding Length"}, {"url": "https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/9800", "abstract": "Automatically recognizing a large number of action categories from videos is of significant importance for video understanding. Most existing works focused on the design of more discriminative feature representation, and have achieved promising results when the positive samples are enough. However, very limited efforts were spent on recognizing a novel action without any positive exemplars, which is often the case in the real settings due to the large amount of action classes and the users' queries dramatic variations. To address this issue, we propose to perform action recognition when no positive exemplars of that class are provided, which is often known as the zero-shot learning. Different from other zero-shot learning approaches, which exploit attributes as the intermediate layer for the knowledge transfer, our main contribution is SIR, which directly leverages the semantic inter-class relationships between the known and unknown actions followed by label transfer learning. The inter-class semantic relationships are automatically measured by continuous word vectors, which learned by the skip-gram model using the large-scale text corpus. Extensive experiments on the UCF101 dataset validate the superiority of our method over fully-supervised approaches using few positive exemplars.", "title": "Exploring Semantic Inter-Class Relationships (SIR) for Zero-Shot Action Recognition"}]
